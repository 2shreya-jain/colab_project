5,Great material and perfect quality!,Great Shoe!
5,Great shoe - I am going to order again.,Great shoe
5,"Solid, Comfortable, and it smells of quality leather. I plan on using Sno-Seal with it as well.

I was between these and the suede version in some shade of brown, but I'm so happy I went with these. The color is great, and it's LEATHER. I feel they will hold up against any conditions I find myself in much better than suede. Although, the suede is more comfortable because of it's floppiness and softness, it only took me a day to adjust to the slightly tougher Beeswax Leather.

Also, if you're on the fence about these or the Bushacres... Nothing comes close to the comfortability of the Natural Crepe sole on the Clarks Original Desert Boot.",Happy I chose the Beeswax. Great Shoe.
5,Perfect,Five Stars
5,Love the price and prime 2day shipping it's great and exactly as pictured,great!
5,"My father in law loves the Carhartt brand. We got him a bunch of Carhartt items for christmas and he enjoys all of them. They are great, thick material. The fit is perfect and he says they are very soft and comfortable. Its long enough that when working it stays tucked in and he can move around comfortably. The material is awesome. He does a lot of outdoor work and mechanist type work. The shirt is durable and stands up to a working mans abuse. It cleans nicely and does not stain easily. They also do not tear easily. If you want a super comfy and durable shirt this is the one for you!",Great durable shirt
5,"This is my 3rd pair . I really enjoy these boots. They are easy on your feet if you have to stand for long periods of time. i also wear them while I am out in the woods. They are waterproof , and you feet stay dry. When this pair wears out I will be looking for my fourth pair.",Great Boots
5,"I received this pair of shoes at the exact same day on the order by ONTRAC.

5,My husband and son in law were very happy with this purchase.  Boots are comfortable and exactly what was needed for work,Would buy again
5,"This is the second pair of this shoe I've owned.  The soles on my old pair are finally worn out after 3 years and they are finally starting to leak a little as of this summer.  I've been having problems getting a good fit with any of the newer models Keen is putting out (I tried 4 different ones at Cabela's this spring), but these ones fit just like they used to.  Now I should be set for another 3 years.",Original (great!) fit.
5,"This boot can take a beating. As with many others in the Asolo line, the break-in period for this boot is little to no time at all. I have owned many pairs of Fugitives, and I have never had foot issues with them. Out of the box one time, I walked over 40 miles in a 24hr period. Waterproofing is great, sole is wonderful, durability is above the mark, and they are simple. Not peppered with plastic parts, there is a reason I have gone through 6 pairs in a little over a decade and keep buying more",Use these right out of the box
5,awesome!!,Five Stars
5,I'm a 5 1/2 - 6. I bought a size 6 and they fit perfect without socks. Hoping they stretch out a little as I wear them. They are super warm and cozy! Very comfortable. More comfy then Uggs,I bought a size 6 and they fit perfect without socks

5,I have wanted a Lauren Wallet forever...found this great price and snatched it up.  It is beautiful!,found this great price and snatched it up
5,"I made a mistake. I have owned my original Seiko diving watch since 1983, using it on hundreds of deepwater dives over the years, actually using the bezel to time my decompression stops, without any problems. I stopped diving over ten years ago due to health issues, but went on a snorkeling trip to Key West recently using my watch. Little did I know that the gaskets and O ring had dried out and thus my watch started to fog up. I took it to a jeweler when I got home. He told me that when he opened the case, the mechanism just fell out and could not be fixed. I even called Seiko but they said the same thing. When I came across this watch on Amazon and the price it was being sold for, I could not pass it up. I think I only paid $130 for the same watch in 1983! Glad I made the investment - maybe this one will last a little longer!",watch only lasts 28 years
5,Excellent,Five Stars
5,"I love this desert boot.  Had a pair like them when I was a young teenager.  Loved em then and love em now.  All the many color selection makes it even better.  With Clark, you can always expect comfort and quality.",Clark desert boot

5,"Great sports bra for D/DD.  I normally wear 36DDD bra and this sports bra fits perfectly.  Although the straps don't adjust they are tight enough for me and I have a short torso.  Great support for moderate activities.  Very comfortable, I could wear all day under a t-shirt.",Love it!

5,I have purchased this shoe before and loved them.  I wore them every day when we went on Vacation to Disney World.  They are the only shoe that doesn't bother my feet walking all those miles each day at the Parks.  I would give them 5 stars.,Slip On shoes

5,have several of this shirt. comfortable,Five Stars
5,I have only tried this pair on for size but have worn them in the past.,Five Stars
5,"Best underwear I've ever had, very comfortable. Snugly and feels like you are wearing nothing throughout the day. It also breathes like no other underwear I've used before. We'll see how it holds up after a year of washing.

Beware counterfit items! out of five orders two came counterfit in just plain open plastic bags. No way to tell if new or used and the stichings gave it away as fake like others have reported. Nasty!",Worth it if you can get it
5,"I bought this bag last year after I broke my toe and had to be on crutches for three months.  It is very well made, as I have found with all the Kipling bags I have bought throughout the years.  There is enough room for my heavy wallet, my cell phone, keys, and a few small things.  The large compartment also has a zippered compartment for papers or other flat objects.  I removed the Velcro from the very small pocket in front, because it took up too much space.  A small snap would work better.  I only use the front pocket for my pen.  If you store the shoulder strap inside the bag, it takes up way too much space, so I just detach it and leave it at home.  This bag adjusts to my hips very well.  I like to wear it just below where the hip bone starts, where I measure 31 inches.  Since it adjusts to wider widths, there is a lot of strap hanging in the back.  I just wrap it back around and stuff it inside the pocket designed to hold the shoulder strap.  Yes, it was expensive.  I think it should be priced $10-$20 dollars less, but the quality is amazing.","Sometimes, you get what you pay for."
5,"I said they are ""somewhat small"", although it is just that they are a little snug over the instep, but I have a high one.  Once they are on, they are very comfortable.  Nice shoe.",Nice shoe.
5,i work security in NYC and it is great cause it keeps me really warm and i am very pleased with it,great for winter
5,"I have ordered various styles of scrubs but this top style is the most comfortable and practical for working in a clinic. Room to lift and bend and pockets where you need them most. Dickie's tend to wash and wear the best for me, really hold up to multiple washings and have had no problems with staining. Would recommend.",comfortable scrub top
5,"I wear these shoes all day at work (8 hours or so) and I'm constantly on my feet going all over the place. It seems weird to wear cute shoes like these to work, but hey, I want to look nice all the time!",It seems weird to wear cute shoes like these to work

5,Good quality and fits really well. I would buy more of these.,Good quality and fits really well.
5,Will never play that price for a pair shoes again,Five Stars
5,"I really like the Riggs Workwear jeans I have. Interestingly, when I ordered a 2nd pair I received a similar style pair of jeans from Carhartt. I'm ok with both, but I'm also certain that the Carhartt's were also a returned item since there were no tags. I suppose I'll just make sure and wash first.",Received wrong product...but still ok
5,"I love that Cinch jeans wash and last well. Much better than LL Bean and some others. My husband loves the comfort. This style seems to be relaxed in the waist as well. Because of that, he can get a smaller size in the waist and they are not so big and baggy in the seat. With most jeans/pants he wears a 34, but a 32 with the Cinch White Label.",Comfort and Long Life

5,I have a particular attachment to this outfit because my two kids enjoyed it so much that my wife and I had to beg them to wear something else!,"The quality is not the best, but my 2 sons love to wear it!"
5,"I have severe Sciatica (L4 laying on L5 and shifted forward). This is my 2nd pair in 4 months, use one for home, one to wear to and from work. Comfortable and less Pain and numbness in my right hip, shin & foot.  I recommend this product to people who need good support and a Light Weight shoe.

5,"My go to pair of boots, I've had several pairs of Clarks over the years. I've worn other brands but I always tend to come back to Clarks, particularly the desert boot. You can keep these looking prime with some extra care and conditioning.","My go to pair of boots, I've had several ..."

5,Nice chain has held up well,Five Stars
5,Fantastic,Five Stars
5,"I am in love with these boots. They take some time to break in, but once that deal is over, they fit so well. The sole is very heavy, and I actually like hearing my boot hit the ground as I'm walking. They're very stylish with jeans or a dress (if you could pull that off). The leather is strong, and I've worn them in the rain once or twice (I try not to) with no soaking. I wish all boots were made with such high quality.",Amazing boots
5,"I discovered Reef Ginger flip flops years ago, and will not buy any other flip flop since. The arch support in these plus fabric uppers, makes them comfortable for all day walking in summer, and no irritation between toes. They do squish over time and lose their support, but they usually last a full summer season for me.
These are really the best!",The best flip flops ever - arch support matters!
5,Great product!,Five Stars
5,"I now have 5 pairs of these wonderful fast-drying shorts. So glad they're still available because I bought my first pair 3 years ago. They feel so soft, like cotton but have all the moisture wicking properties of supplex. I'm 5'3"" 120 lbs (28"" waist) and I ordered medium because I wanted smooth fit but not too snug, so the legs sometimes rise up a little after sitting. The length is perfect on me and the waist is perfect - no rolls! I wash them in cold water, regular cycle and throw them in the dryer on low. No shrinking or fading. Highly recommend!","The softest, fast drying bike shorts ever!"

Ashton Kutcher wears these Adidas Sambas in the 2010 film Valentine's Day. So wear this pair of shoes and feel yourself a star!

5,"Love them. Second pair purchased. Owned first pair for 6 years for work and upper leather still looked new, but sole was pretty worn.",Love them
5,"Got these for my husband, who has a limited selection to choose from due to the narrowness of his feet.  We generally get athletic shoes for him, but he now has some difficulty with the laces, and these are a great solution.  He says they are very comfortable and easy to put on and take off...plus he has already gotten several compliments on them!","Great for large, narrow, feet!"
5,"This little watch does everything it claims to do.

5,"I purchased a pair of these in Florida around 5 years ago and they are finally getting fatigued to the point they are unsightly but still function just fine but my wife won't let me leave the house with them. I was excited to find these on Amazon as I have never worn a more comfortable and more durable sandal than what these are. Living in south Louisiana they have to deal with mud, rocks, sand, cement, asphalt, swamp, etc and when most rip and come apart these have just kept on chugging along. With definitely keep buying as longa s they are available.",... the point they are unsightly but still function just fine but my wife won't let me leave the house ...

Went to 2nd Ortho , he asked what do you do for a living, told him auto sales. Look at my shoes (Bally Loafers) Said the shoes you are wearing are like driving a car without shock absorbers. Said spend the money and get yourself a pair of ECCO's.

I should probably purchase another pair for future use when these eventually wear out. Now if I could only find them in brown...,Very Nice Deer Stag Loafers
5,"Ordered this through Amazon Prime, and it showed up two business days later -got to love that!
In any case, the sunglasses are great.  They come with a case, cleaning cloth, and a small blurb on how to care for your new shades.  Maybe this is all standard for sunglasses like this -but for someone who used to wear $10 sunglasses (they kept breaking!), I am was quite pleased with the quality of the case, and the sunglasses.
I got the 52mm ones.  I read some reviews that said the 52mm should only be bought for kids ... false.  I am 5'8"", 140lbs, and the 52mm's works perfect.  The 55mm's would work too, but I don't like the bigger lenses.  So unless you're a larger person, or have fuller face, or have very big cheeks, I think the 52mm will be nice on you.",Excellent Product

5,"I bought these sandals over a year ago before I moved overseas to West Africa.  Living in a warm/hot climate, I wanted some good supportive sandal for everyday living that also looked cute/stylish.  While I love the look of these shoes I found one very frustrating thing about them-sand would constantly get in them and it was hard to get it out.  It was just annoying so I didn't wear them too often.  Then I got pregnant, and I grew and grew...  Now these sandals are the only ones that give me the support that I need.  So I wear them every day!  Thank you Birkenstock for creating a supportive sandal!!","Sand gets in easily, but the sandal has great support!"

5,"I've ordered Rago's Women's High-Waisted Long Leg Shaper before, so I know how its sizing works. Rago's sizing is closer to vintage sizing. You can't order your normal dress size in Rago. The company doesn't vanity size like most modern women's clothing companies. You must order this shapewear based on your hip size, which is what I did. That means I ordered two sizes larger than my dress size. Once on, the shaper feels very firm and smooths me out under my dresses and skirts. Despite the compression, I find it very comfortable  to wear.

5,"I love these shoes. I've literally been wearing this same model and color for the past six years. I'm on my fourth pair in that amount of time and I wear them every single day of the year, rain or shine.

If you want to have them last longer be sure to waterproof them every month or so in order to keep them dry. After awhile they start to soak up water which will make the rubber around the toe begin to separate. That happened with the first pair that I had and then I started treating them with the spray to avoid this failure.

The only other problem I've experienced is with the heel cup breaking. That's more an artifact of me being really rough with putting my shoes on and probably stepping on the backs too often.",Great shoes. I'm on my fourth pair in six years. Worn every day.

5,"Our first Pulsar watch was bought nearly 30 yr. ago, has been worn almost daily and it still runs, although it shows exterior wear. The battery has been replaced about every 3 yr. From about 18 yr. ago and until about 3 yr. ago there was a Seiko outlet store near us and we bought other Pulsar and Seiko watches for the family. We have been very satisfied with the value, quality, style and reliability of Seiko watches. The reviewed purchase (SWZ056) is very similar in function and appearance to the 30 yr. old Pulsar, except for the face color (gold vs. white). The watch is sufficiently large to tell time easily, but not so large as to appear bulky. On viewing the photo of this watch on Amazon, we were initially concerned about ability to distinguish the gold hands on the gold face. While they are not as clearly visible as gold on white, differentiation is better than the Amazon picture reveals and it has not been a problem so far (1 month's use). (The preferred gold hands-on-white face was much more expensive!) The gold-silver styling of the SWZ056 watch enables it to be worn with gold or silver accessories and has a style suitable for daily or dress-up (but not formal) wear. This style watch band has been problem free in past purchases.",Seiko women's watch SWZ056

I wear a 42C and it can be challenging to find bras in that size that actually fit. This one fits like a dream and the support is AMAZING. I can't say enough about how supportive it is.

5,"I am a ""watch guy"" and a fan of automatic dive watches.  I have owned an Omega Seamaster as well as a Seiko Monster.  For the price this is an AMAZING value!  I like big watches and need something with ""presence"" on the wrist - the Grand Diver delivers - a huge watch but after a while ou get used to the size and it just feels right.  I have the older model with the Miyota movement - keep fantastic time - up to COSC standards better than my Seiko and as good as my Omega when it was new.  The bracelet is fantastic - double safety latch and the thick stainless hinge is an amazing touch for a watch of this price. The blue face looks black, purple or blue depending upon the ambient light of the room - very attractive. After spending $1700 on my Omega it required service after about 6 years - would have cost several hundred dollars so I sold it - at $110 the Grand Diver looks better (IMHO), keeps as good time, has great water resistance and if it dies in a few years certainly cheap enough to get another ( although I have heard the Miyota and Seiko movements in these are bullet proof and long lasting). The only negative and a very slight one is that the bezel is a little looser than I would like - ratchets one way as it should but not as tight as my Seiko - certainly not terrible.  In fact I have been wearing the Grand Diver just about every day and gave the Seiko Monster to my son for his18th birthday.  I don't really understand the deep discounting Invicta pricing system but feel this watch is worth what they have listed as retail - seriously thinking of getting another to keep stashed in case this model is discontinued!",One watch will rule them all...

With metal not plastic hooks I have not had a hint of stress on where my bag and this strap meet. The middle part of the strap that contacts your shoulder is a durable neoprene that makes this strap work like a Cadillac. The neoprene grips the shoulder part of what your wearing but also flexes and stretches as you walk. This is what I like is that the jostling of the bag doesn't get transferred to you. This shock absorber takes the beating.

I have had this for a few months and used it for several trips and daily for work. Its shown no signs of wear and tear. I highly recommend for a replacement strap as good or better than the original hands down.  Well worth the price.",Great Replacement Strap that Rides like a Caddy.

5,"This is my second one of these watches. My first I have owned for approximately 30 years. This was ""the watch"" for US Military before Luminox or Casio. This watch is automatic winding, winds itself from the motion of your arm. No battery to replace or be worried about failing at inopportune times. About every 5 years or so, I send it back to Seiko for servicing. For $100.00 Seiko will open the watch, service it, re-seal it back to factory standards and GUARANTEE accuracy to 1 minute/ 3 months. I only replaced my old one due to it being an older model (made in 1981) and certain parts were no longer available. I still have it, it has just been relegated to yard work. If you watch sporting events, you will see Rolex used for timing for tennis and golf, when precise timing is not important. For swimming and track and field, where split second timing is required, you will see Seiko or Omega being used.",The best affordable dive watch made.

5,"I LOVE these tights. I was looking for a good pair in black for some dressier outfits, and decided to try ordering online for once. Pleasantly impressed. They're very opaque (tights, not stockings), and super soft and comfortable. They also seem like they're a little more resistant to snags than most other tights I've tried.

Be sure to order one, or even two, sizes up from what you think you might need, because they do run small. I followed that advice from the other reviews and I got a perfect fit. Besides, you'd have to go quite far to get tights that are ""too big"" on most people, so if in doubt go a size up. You very likely will not regret doing so.

I definitely plan on ordering the same product if I need another pair or color.","Fantastic tights, but run small"

5,"I read other people's reviews before buying my Timex and as in all things in life, everyone has their opinion.  One of the things I found preposterous were the comments about the band.  It's designed to be secure on your wrist.  The fact that the small loop kind of ""locks"" in the strap is a good thing.  Some people complained that it was too hard to undo.  I do it everyday with one hand and could do so blindfolded.  If you can't get the strap undone without breaking a sweat, one handed or two, I would suggest you never leave the house because you are uncoordinated to the point of being dangerous.  The large numerals on the face have also been criticized which is also a mystery to me.  It simply makes reading the pertinent data easy and fast with no guess work and with a quick look.  I also like the fact that it is so light that I'm not even aware of wearing it which is very good in a a sports watch.  The ONLY negative I have is that you have to hit the ""Stop"" button twice when in interval mode and the time you want to stop on corresponds to the interval itself.  Not a big deal.  I hit the stop button twice in succession.  It's a fine product that does what it's supposed to.",What's not to like?

My shoe size ranges anywhere from 6 to 7 (depending on brands) and the small is the perfect size, plus I knew they would stretch a bit.

5,"Reading all the reviews, I went back and forth between ordering a size up or sticking with my normal size, 8.5. I lucked out on ordering 8.5 and the shoes fit like a GLOVE! This is my 2nd pair of KEENs and I don't think I will ever wear anything else. I was a big Merrel fan, till they started to break down on me...I wrote to the company which basically said ""send us your unworn shoe back for consideration for replacement"" well, how am I suppose to do that after wearing a pair for a year or so and the sole literally splits off and falls off...or a shoe lace hoop snaps...

I have read reviews were people have had pairs for over 10 years, and they look brand new...and I have seen people with pairs for years and years, so I know they will last.

I love the color of these shoes, grey with a splash of burgundy/plum. When you walk on pavement, the rubber soles cushion your step very well. The toe protector in a dark grey takes a bit to getting used to, as it kinda sticks out for me, but these are for hiking/lake fun so toe protection will great...they have a newer line which offers a more stylish approach to the toe protector, but since they are newer you will pay for them!

5,"See, the title's a pun for all the owners out there. About the only con I can think of for this watch is that it took me about a day to fully understand the intricacies of the clasp/buckle/whathaveyou. Otherwise, it's quite simply the most stunning watch I've ever owned.

It's got an adjustable buckle despite having a metal mesh band, and this was one of the major points for me, because I've got huge wrists. It fits very well and is even a bit loose, where other watches (Fossil, I'm looking at you) fit too snugly or don't fit at all. Like I said, there's a trick to the buckle: Pop the top safety, use your finger to open the second safety, grab the second safety with your finger and put your thumb on the band and pull upward to unlatch the hook, and voila, you're done! It's going to take a few tries to get the hang of it, but it's really well-done; that watch ain't comin' off your wrist unless YOU want it to.

It's very well-made, the face is dazzling, the band is texturally wonderful, and it's my absolute favorite watch. I hope you'll enjoy yours too, should you decide to make this purchase.",Hooked on this watch.

To buy a pair of danner from amazon. after read thru comments/posts. finally Acadia Uniform Boot was bought. a few days waiting. I have to say, thank you buddy, Danner is the best!

They are fairly easy to move around in once you get them on and they keep him warm while he's outside shoveling or working in the yard.

5,"This is my - I think - seventh watch. The problem with my other watches: quazt movements have to replace the battery after a while; automatic movement stops working if I don't wear it for a few days. So I purchased this watch. The movement is running with natural or artificial light, so I can be worry free from the watch stops working because battery or no movement.

I think it would be nice if the watch's body can be made little thinner. But in general I am very please with the watch's look.

I didn't see the problem that the other reviewer said about the three winds didn't line up at 12. Mine works perfectly.

5,"I'm pleased with this bag.  It does not fold up into a little package like some, but it is light weight and when empty would not take up much space in your luggage, about as much as a folded dress shirt.

The bag is made of ripstop material that is treated for water resistance..  There is a large main compartment and a smaller compartment in front that has some small pockets for pencils, media devices, etc., but which do no get in the  way of you don't have a need for them.

The front compartment has one zipper and the main compartment has two.  The zippers seem to be of good quality.

There is a mesh pocket on one side for carrying a water bottle.

I don't often use a backpack.  But after taking a couple of cruises I realized that I need one for shore excursions so that I can carry a water bottle, a rain jacket and/or umbrella if weather is questionable, bug spray, etc,  and a  place to put whatever I might buy while on the excursion.

This bag is a perfect size for my use.  Not too large, not too small, and treated to resist rain.","Lightweight, Well Made, Right Size For My Purpose"

The size of the shirt is to be based upon the size of one's hips (according to the chart).  I have a slender build, but I used the sizing chart when ordering the shirts and they came to me a perfect fit.  They fit as well as any of my other shirts.",Great shirt

However, these boots, though they didn't fit, i really liked the appearance and feel, the zipper is really handy and they seem durable, i'll edit this review once i've received my hopefully fitting size of these boots. Some say it fits as expected, but if you aren't exactly sure, i'd say order a half size smaller than what you regularly wear.","Great build, great boot, may run a bit big."

5,"I am very pleased with this watch and thus far have had no problems. On the screen it clearly shows the time (down to seconds), the day and the date. It is comfortable and easy to set. I wear this watch everyday and have been doing so for over a year and there is little to no wear and tear damage. I have also worn it swimming and in the shower a couple times and have had no problems. There are some reviews here that complain about the screen getting water under it and fogging up. In my experience I have found that no matter what watch you get or however much it says it is water resistant no watch is completely water resistant. I would never recommend intentionally wearing a watch in water unless you really need to (even if it says it is water resistant). If you are a swimmer you can gamble the dice but no matter what the watch says about water resistance chances are it will eventually get water under the screen especially with natural wear and tear over time.

Overall I really like this watch and would recommend it.

5,"Why did I not buy these sooner?

TL;DR: Great shoes.  Fit big feet.  Comfortable.  Don't feel like clogs/slippers.

I am someone who values my time and..... oh hell... I'm lazy.  I slip my shoes off by holding down the heel with the other foot, and put them on before leaving for work by sticking my foot back in.  As such, I tend to destroy the heels of all my shoes.
(I'm a computer tech, so I mostly wear sneakers or ""casual"" shoes)
For years I'd thought about getting these sort of shoes, and for years I'd held off because I have huge feet (15) and usually only new balance fit my foot correctly without a break-in period.

I can now say there's an exception to that rule.  I got the 14s of these the first time around, because people said they ran big.  Not so.  14 was too small, so I went to 15, and they're perfect.  They also have arch support that at first felt weird, but now feels like something I don't know how I lived without.  They have also felt like a broken-in pair since the first (maybe second) day I wore them.

If I have any complaint, it's that they pick up a TON of sand/salt/ice/snow in the tread and keep dropping it for a good half hour once you get to your destination in winter.  At home I take off my shoes at the door, but I notice it at work when my chair is crunching over sand from the parking lot.

Most importantly, however, I've been wearing these for a couple weeks now, all day, every day, and they still slip on and off with ease, but don't feel floppy on my feet when I'm walking over weird terrain.  If I had any wish, I guess it'd be that they make a pair with mesh in the toe area.  They do get a little warm at times, but I don't see an easy way to do that with the design.

Overall.... well, I guess the fact that I'm planning to buy a second pair speaks for itself.",Great shoes.  Fit big feet.  Comfortable.  Don't feel like clogs/slippers.

5,"Glad I read all of the reviews on these great Mocs before ordering- saves sending back the wrong size! I am a pretty solid 9.5 in most close toe shoes. I even have a pair of Minnetonka boat Mocs in a 9.5. I ordered these in a 9 per reviews and they are a perfect fit. I think all of their Mocs run on the narrow side which is fine for me.

These are unlined suede so I'm sure they will stretch and conform to my feet. They have a suede lining which is great bc I wear them without socks.  I did push a sock covered foot into them just to see, and that worked with this size too. Not a lot of support which is not an issue for me, and to be expected in a moccasin.

I got the grey and it's a darker medium grey. They were comfy right out of the box, and I expect to get a lot of wear out of them. Excellent price has me thinking about ordering them in Brown as well!!

5,"This was ordered for my Husband but is unisex. I can't see many woman wearing it in this color at least or in the style. It is well made with thick sturdy material. The small logo on the side of it has a butterfly in it as if it was a girls hat. But it is small and not very noticable. It says one size fits most on the tag but inside it says large. It is a little tight on my husband so I am not sure if it is actually a large in Womans or if there is ever a size difference in womans and mens hats. But he likes it. I feel the price was worth it. The color was pretty spot on as the one in the pic. It has vent holes which is a plus for my husband with strong SPF rating. I didn't know hats had SPF ratings. Can UV rays actually go through hats without SPF? It sounds nice but not sure it matters.
It's a great hat all around and I feel it will last for quite a while.","Nice, Well made"

5,"These UA boxerjocks are super comfortable and very high quality.

If you are on the higher end of a particular size I recommend going to the next size higher as these are underwear not compression shorts, I am normally size large (36-38 waist) and the XL fit perfect. You will be amazed, you cannot even tell you are wearing underwear, no roll-ups on the leg and no pinching the boys or their glove.

The binding on the thigh from the 9"" inseam took some getting use to as I am not use to anything tight around my thigh but after approx 5 minutes I could not even tell they were on. Nothing I hate worse then underwear creeping up the leg or crotch so I highly recommend the 9"" inseam as they do stay were you want them.

Worth every cent, pricey I know but how can you put a $$ figure on all day comfort. The jock section offers nice support without undue compression. The wide and soft waistband is extremely comfortable. Based upon reviews I read before I purchased these underwear they seem to last years and years, so in the long run they are cost effective.

Cotton underwear (previously used 2(x)ist and they started to fall apart after one year) for me are history, nothing but UA underwear in my underwear drawer.","Highly recommend these underwear, 5 stars!"

As with all Chuck Taylor's made by a Converse, these are well made and really do hold up well over time. The fact that my son had his last pair for just shy of a year after wearing them primarily - says a lot! As a matter of fact, had it not been for the fact that they got rust stained from stepping into a puddle of rusty water - I don't think we would have replaced them yet.

At almost $10 less than I can buy them in any store (in person or online) made these a phenomenal deal, and I'm hoping the next time we need to buy them, this seller will still have this great price.

I had to have all white nursing shoes for school and they were so awesome I had to buy these for everyday! They are very comfortable. I can wear regular shoes and these were almost too snug.

5,I've had shoes that look similar to these however there is no substitute for quality. These shoes have exceeded my expectations for how long they last.

5,"I purchased this backpack before a weekend trip across the country from Tennessee to California.  I got the Porter 46 to replace my Transporter 46, which is the Porter 46's non-backpack, PITA-to-schlepp-through-a-big-airport cousin.  I stuck with Osprey brand because my Transporter has held up very well, is well-built, and has a lifetime warranty.

First, the Porter 46 is quite roomy. For my trip, the bag carried a suit and dress shirt, two pairs of shoes, PJs, and 3 days of underwear and casual wear.  I also had my security blanket, laptop + charger, 3 1"" textbooks, a notebook, and toiletries.  I also crammed in a Kelty hip pack that had food and electronics.  Since that trip I've used it several times for weekend trips and can fill it with all the clothes I need plus 20-30lbs of tools.

The two handles on this bag are very comfortable and won't rub your hand raw if you choose to carry the bag rather than wear it.  The backpack straps and hip strap are fairly comfortable--I wouldn't go hiking with this pack, but they are more than adequate for travelling (and they can be tucked away in the back panel). It fits just fine in an overhead bin.  The gray sidewalls are stiff foam, which helps the Porter keep its shape and give it some protection from the savage baggage handlers.  The two compression straps have clips to hold the loose end of the straps. There is a document pocket on the opening panel, as well as a pocket on the top of the bag, which is big enough to separate dirty or wet laundry, or a pair of shoes from the rest of the bag.  There are 2 mesh pouches on the inside - one runs the length of the sidewall and one covers the inside of the opening panel.  There are also two heavy duty rings on the side to attach a carrying strap if you choose to carry your pack that way, along with 4 D-rings to attach a daypack.  The main zipper is a YKK #7 - very durable.

Overall: very high-quality, good-looking, roomy, and comfortable travel pack from a reputable company.",Osprey Porter 46 - worth every penny.

5,"This is the second pair of Rainbow Sandals I have purchased. They are GREAT quality. I can understand the price being somewhat of a turn off but if you want some sandals that will last forever, these are the ones to buy. The other pair I bought I still wear and I have had them for 3 years now! They are definitely in used condition (my first pair) but the strap between the toes is still holding strong. They really make these sandals to last. All the other brands I have tried have nothing on this brand. The strap would always break some 3-4 months in.
This particular type of sandals fit fantastic. Great arch support (although I've never had a big problem with that). They do take a week or two to get worn in as the sandal will mold to your foot. I will say that is can be uncomfortable to wear the first week or so but you will be amazed at how comfortable they are after they have been broken in. Great quality. I HIGHLY recommend this brand!",EXCEPTIONAL quality sandals! These are a must buy for anyone that loves to wear sandals.

I eventually went with this watch since I dive / spearfish and this Seiko is was more of an actual divers watch and not just a divers style watch. Although the amazon description didn't say anything about it, I found everywhere else online said that this watch comes with a wetsuit extension (divers extension). This was not the case! I was throughly disappointed when I received the watch and the bracelet had no extension. I decided to keep the watch despite the lack of this extension as I love the look and feel of the watch. Thus far it is keeping great time and I have received many compliments on it. On the Seiko side I am very happy with everything (despite the divers extension, which I am still not sure why this doesn't have one), but Amazon took 3 days just to ship this item out their doors.",Great Watch Thus Far

5,"There are the heaviest and best work and all around pocket t shirts . I like I can get tall sizes that never show a plumbers crack and tuck in well keeping in warmth  . The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying  . They shrink a tad . Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best . They stain less and the same goes for other wear and tear. I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .

Keds are good to go anytime of the year when it isn't snowing or raining hard. And I still love them today.","An Old-School Fave, Still Fits & Feels Great!"

5,"I'm on my feet alot. I use to have problems with my feet being very painfull. Not only did they hurt while I was standing up, they would throb when I would sit down.  When I would stand back up, the shooting pain I would experience made it hard to walk.  I tried these shoes after reading reviews by others with my problem.  Like them, my pain has gone away.  Even aflter being on my feet for eight to ten straight hours my feet don't hurt.(My knees and legs do) I have tried many different brands with little or no results.  These shoes aren't as durable as I would like, other brands last longer.  I am hard on shoes and use these in a lot of mud and rain doing farm work, so I need to replace these every four to five months.  In drier weather and on pavement they would probably last longer. Even so, I still buy these for the comfort which is the most important for me.  I would definitly recommend these shoes to anyone with serious foot pain.","Like them, my pain has gone away"

I'm on my feet in the lab 7 hours a day, so my feet are important to keep comfortable. I also have high arches and these provide decent arch support.

One thing to note is that there is a strong ""catch"" on the heel of the boot to grip your heel when hiking. When I wore standard socks I found that the heel was not padded enough and gave me some chafing. I highly recommend heel-padded boot socks. I have a set of Theros socks and they work great with these boots.

Totally waterproof, dry quick, and do not stain easily. Tested in mud, seawater, mountain streams.

5,"The majority of critical reviews suggest that the shoe runs a bit narrow, but overall I feel that it fits as it should. The general quality of this shoe is just astounding. I've been an avid sperry enthusiast for some time now, but in the past few years as the hype for them has just grown, the quality has gone down. (More likely due to the mass-production of them) Needless to say, this shoe is absolutely great. the leather is hard and rigid. You definitely need to break them in for the first couple wears, but afterwards they are the best. My favorite thing about this shoe is the foot lining on the inside. Since the leather is hard and durable, it seems to soak up any moisture when wearing them for prolonged periods of time.

It's a tough watch, much better than digital watches. The numbers and hands illuminate really well and stay illuminated for a lengthy period. Just like my old Timex wind up, that I still have and wear from to time.",I absolutely love this watch

I normally wear 10.5 but they don't sell half sizes so I went with size 11. I think 10.5 would still have been ideal.

I am fuller in the waste and went by my waste measurement and they fit perfect. follow these directions and there shouldn't be a problem.

5,"I've owned the Swiss Army Infantry Watch # 24695 for about three weeks and have had no problems with it other than having to re-adjust the date because November ends on the 30th but the watch advanced to the 31st the next day. I noticed on the Dec 2nd the watch said the 1st. I guess this will have to be adjusted after every month ending on the 30th and February the 28th.

There is one error in Amazon's description above saying the crystal is mineral. The instruction book and other websites I've seen the 24695 advertised on, indicate the watch has a sapphire crystal. Also it says Sapphire Crystal right on the back of the watch.

The first week I had it I wound it once. I didn't wear it for two days and the watch stopped. The watch automatically winds itself from the movement caused by your arm moving. Don't worry you can't overwind it while its on your wrist. There is slip clutch inside that prevents overwinding. Somewhere I thought I read the watch will run about 48 hours if it is sitting on your dresser. If you wear it everyday you will never have to wind it.

The leather band was nice but I had a jeweler shop swap it out for a silver stretch band. I have unusually skinny wrists and buckle band straps never did fit me right.

The watch makes no noise when it runs, unless my hearing is bad?...

One other thing is you have to make sure when you first set it that your on the right time of day  in order for the date & day to flip to the next day & date. The day & date changes at around 12:01:08 am. (Eight seconds past 12:01 am). Mine was off twelve hours so I had to adujust it ahead when the day & date didn't change till the next day at noon time.

The days are printed in English and Spanish.

The back of the case is clear and you can see the intricate parts moving. I don't intend on swimming with on or showering with it on, but it is waterproof to something like 300 feet {100 meters} of water.

I am happy overall with the 24695. I wish a silver or white face were available on this model number. WIth it being winter I haven't really looked at the watch outside in the dark, because of wearing jackets and long sleeve shirts, but the black face with white number and hands should be able to be seen alright as long as there is some available light outside.

The hands and dots inline with the numbers are luminous. Hold the watch up to a light bulb then turn it off and they will glow. The numbers do not glow. In place of the number 12 is the red & Silver Swiss Army shield logo. Because of the placement of the Swiss Army logo and the date & day, the numbers 23, 24, 12, 13 and 15 are not on the inner dial display for the 24 hour military time.

My watch was shipped from Texas. The price is certainly right on Amazon.com

I checked at a Macy's store (in Chicago & Orland Park, IL.) one day and the 24695 would have cost $495.00 + tax. Same goes for a few of the local Jewelery stores that carried the 24695.

Update: January 19th the watch is still working great. It looks like the value went up since I purchased mine. I paid around $280 including shipping..

5,"This watch was one of my best purchases yet and I've had it for about two years now. I get lots of compliments on the looks and design. I've taken it surfing, to the beach, on camping trips and I always wear it while swimming and while in the shower. It's been to 20 feet depth when I took it in the pool while learning how to scuba dive. The expandable band doesn't fit over the 7mm wetsuit that I tried and slid right off the 4/3mm wetsuit that I have, so I just wear the watch underneath my wetsuit and peel the wetsuit back to look at the watch.

The only problem I had with it was when I fell of my skateboard so hard that one band popped off and I bent one of the holding pins for the bands. I got the pin replaced (the local watch shop had the correct size pin in stock for $8) and the watch is still working fine. The battery hasn't shown any signs of wearing out. The crystal face is very scratch resistant, but has shown signs of wear after being put in my pocket with my keys. So lesson learned, don't rub it with a metal object on purpose. Even though there are a number of scratches, the face is still very visible. I never had troubles with the rotating bezel, unlike other reviewers, and would feel comfortable adjusting where it is pointing even with dive gloves on. I like that you have to put a little bit of force to turn it, since that stops me from playing with it all the time in meetings.

I used to wear only smaller, lightweight watches and this was my first heavier large watch. It felt different for the first week, but then I got used to it and came to appreciate its size. I have a very skinny bone structure but it looks great on my smallish wrists. I was able to adjust the band size on my own using a needle and a small hammer to pop the individual link pins out and set the new pins. I can't comment on timing accuracy since I've had to adjust the watch multiple times in a year to account for changing time zones.","Extremely Durable, Good Looks"

I have been recently changing my entire wardrobe from sneakers, tshirts, and hoodies to button downs, sweaters and boots. I was a bit hesitant at first, however after hours of research on style from websites such askmen, reddit, etc I felt pretty confident buying a clarks desert boot. I checkedout a few other products clarks had to offer and found that this type of shoe was probably one of the more stylistshoe amoung them all. The fit was great, pretty comfortable even though it doesnt appear to be, and the quality of the shoe is fantastic I can feel that this shoe is going to last me a long time. I also like how easily I can slip on the shoe and just walk right out the door. Some cons: you will have to break the boot in,the back lip of the boot was a bit irritating at first. The surface of the shoe can be easily scratched so youll notice a few marks here and there but overtime theyll blend right in with the rest of the shoe. I didn't know this but apparently the bottoms of the shoes will turn a blackish color after wearing them just once, its fine though you won't be able to see it from the sides of your shoe.

5,"I can say, ""I love this watch.""  And, I've already gotten many compliments.  I read many of the reviews on Amazon before deciding to purchase the watch online, unseen.  The issues people have raised about the hands not lining up or any other functional issue have not been a problem with this item.  Some purchasers did not like the 60 click bezel.  I have both 60 click and 120 click bezels, I believe the 60 has a more solid feel to it while the 120 feels smoother.  You should go with your personal preference.  From other Citizens and a handful of Seiko's I own, I am not a big fan of many rubber dive straps.  I knew this going in, but was pleasantly surprised by the feel of this one.  I could have left it on.  But I had already purchased an after-market bracelet for the watch.  I have several Citizen Eco-drives and have had no issues with them.  Citizen does have a tendency of creating their own, unique attachment systems for their bands.  This can be problematic if you like to customize the look of your watch.  Luckily this watch has been around for a while and you can very easily pick up adapters that will allow almost any 24mm band to be attached.  I was able to get the adapters and a very nice steel bracelet for $100.  When combined, this makes for an exceptional looking and solid watch.  As long as you understand it is going to be a good sized watch, the rubber band is going to be a little stiff, the bezel is 60 clicks, and you'll need to buy an adapter to start customizing this is a great watch.","""I love this watch"

5,"What kind of socks a person likes to wear is purely a matter of personal preference, but I've tried a lot of different types of hosiery over the years, these have turned out to be just about perfect for me. Like all Gold Toe socks, they wear like iron, but they also look and feel great. They are definitely the dressy type made for wearing to the office, but I have found them so comfortable that I also wear them on the weekend, too. While they aren't fluffy like athletic socks, they are still pretty cushy - i.e., not the thin type like a lot of dress socks made for men out of nylon. They have a fairly high wool content, which means they keep your feet dry in the summer and insulated/warm in the winter, but they also have just the right amount of stretch to go on easily and to stay up on your leg. These are definitely on the long side (over the calf), and will come up to an inch or two below your knee, which is where I like them so that they don't roll down on you. I bought both black and blue colors, and after at about 10 to 15 washes, they have proved to be totally colorfast, and have not faded in the least. I highly recommend these as a top quality product.",My Favorite Socks

I researched online for a comparable shoe but was very unhappy with what I bought (Saucony Cohesion 5).  I'm so delighted to find them again.

5,"Having wide feet and wanting high quality leather boots, preferably not in a neon colour, this is the way to go.

Over the last 15 or so years I have worn nothing but Puma King Top shoes. The lightweight high quality kangaroo leather is (in my opinion) a lot better than the lightweight plastic shoes that you see everywhere.
I like the fit, as I have wide feet, and these nicely stretch like thin leather boots should. I normally buy them half a size small, so within a couple of games they fit like a sock.

No problems with blisters, and the sole is just sturdy enough to prevent bone bruising in the ball of the foot even when playing on rock solid soil in the south.
These boots typically last me a calendar year or more, and seeing that I play on them at least 4 times a week, sometimes for 5 hours at a time, it is very impressive.

The only negative that I've encountered is that the stitching of the very tip of the boot tends to get damaged, and therefore can lead to the sole letting go. This normally is the last bit of life I am squeezing out of an old pair, and that is honestly the only problem I have encountered. Seeing as a lot of my team mates end up having to tape the front of their boots together, it seems to be a problem that happens with high end leather as well as the newer synthetic boots they sell a lot.

So, for any weather or surface, got get some of these, you will not regret it!",Will wear this boot as long as they keep making it

5,"I have way too much jewelry. I've tried a bunch of methods to keep them straight. I have two jewelry boxes and a wall unit of earrings. But I still have more. Maybe I need to stop buying jewelry.

Anyway, I had tried putting earrings that I didn't wear often in a craft sorter but then I wore them even less. Well, never actually.

So I wanted something that would keep them organized but easy to access. I searched through hundreds of pages on Amazon as well as Pintrest (there are some fun ways to organize but nothing for jewelry hoarders like me). This was my choice and so far I'm very happy.

Make no mistake. This is not a small organizer. It is large and may not fit into many drawers so measure first if you want to tuck it away. The compartments are flocked (lined with a soft, velvety fuzz) and come in a variety of sizes. I have room for hanging earrings, short earrings and multiple earring pairs in each spot. There is also room for average (not thick bands) rings in the middle.

The 'cover' is really just a thick acetate that is cut to sit on top. Not really a cover in my book but enough to keep dust out and allow for quick access.","Nice, Large Compartments"

Nothing really worked for me.

After reading the reviews for the Montrail Molokini, I decided to take the plung and order a pair. I am so glad I did! These are the most comfortable shoes I've found in a long time. I haven't baked and shaped them, but plan to do that soon. Even without the custom fit, they are awesome. I highly recommend these to anyone in need of comfy summer sandals.

This box chain is exactly what I was looking for and at such an incredible price!  Sure I could go to the mall and spend twice if not three times as much as this chain, and pray that it did not break.  I love this chain for the length and the shine and sparkle it gives off when you wear it!  It is quite sturdy hence the item description as I wear it to sleep.  I am one of those people who doesn't take their jewelry off at night.  Otherwise, I'd forget to put it on.  I love the fact that it is nickel free, since i have a slight allergy to it.  This is a great gift item for anyone of any age.  Find a cute pendant to go along with it and you've got a great gift at an amazing price!  I think I'll actually get a 20"" so I can layer my pendants.  I also love that it doesn't pinch my at all.  I've had previous chains that like to pinch my neck.

5,"This shirt was a hit at our family's white elephant gift exchange.  My brother-in-law was thrilled to wear it home, and it fit him perfectly.  I do want to make a note about the size - I held the men's large up next to one of my husband's size large Hanes t-shirts, and while the torso width was the same, the shoulders of the wolf shirt were a few inches wider, so the shirt seems to be well sized for men with bulky arms/shoulders.",We love it.

5,"This is the real deal.  Mink oil is a superior leather conditioner.  I apply it once or twice a year to my old Italian-made (not the current low-grade version) Vasque Sundowners from the 1990s.  This is all these boots need to stay in good shape aside from the occasional resoling.  It's also useful for baseball gloves, rifle slings, leather attache cases, and almost anything that is made of leather except, obviously, suede.  It soaks in pretty quickly, but it will still feel tacky for a day or more depending on how much you used, how thirsty your leather is, and how humid it is.

This stuff needs to be applied yearly or so, unless possibly if you are storing your leather in an airtight container.  It does soak into the leather and make it more supple, especially if you use a lot, which might actually be undesired.  If you are breaking in leather boots, gloves, or straps it could be useful to use quite a bit just to get the leather bending how you like, only to apply sparingly in the future to prevent the leather from drying out.

Proprietary synthetic leather treatments are no longer part of my leather care regimen.  They may waterproof better, but I find that they do destroy good leather over time because they do not actually restore its suppleness, and they block other leather treatments from deep penetration.

One tub should last many years.  If you got a dozen tubs they will be handing them down long after you are dead.",Mink oil is a superior leather conditioner

5,"I wear a size 10. It's nice and big on me, so I can wrap it in different ways. I think it would fit larger sizes too. For me, sarongs are  prettier and more versatile than baggy beach tunics. My legs aren't my best part, so a sarong is perfect for me. Other women might have great legs but need to cover their upper half with a beach tunic. Depends on what works for you.","Pretty, nice material, big."

With that said these are heavier than your average Magnum or 5.11 boots, but these boots are solid and wear very well.  These boots have a break in period so give them some time to adjust to your feet. Danner has one of the best customer service departments around and that's few and far between these days.

5,"We just received this Wigwam wool watch cap this morning and cannot be any happier with our choice! Perfect timing as we are having a bit of a cold snap in San Diego so we put it to the test immediately.

There are numerous benefits to this product over your standard and most likely, imported acrylic beanie. First is that is made out of 100% worsted wool and it is made in the USA.

This product easily rates Five Gold Stars +1 if we could. It is a testament to made in the USA quality in fit, function and undeniable classic style. If you experience fitting issues those are easy to change. If it is too small, wearing it will stretch it out. If it is too large, popping it in the dryer will shrink it to fit. This goes the same if you feel it has stretched too much over time or if your head got smaller :).

The 100% worsted wool construction makes this an incredibly durable item. In addition, the made in the USA quality insures the perfection of a decades old pattern that gives it a quality finish and stylish fit unlike the sloppier versions of imported acrylic lookalikes. Its price to value ration makes this a bargain and a fantastic value at this price point. In fact, you may even pay more if you purchase an inferior acrylic beanie if it is ostentatiously branded. You might look cool with a manufacturers logo emblazoned on your beanie but for that you are one, paying a premium price and two, getting an inferior made product.

Worsted wool is the warmest natural yet still breathable material you can get. Pop this on your bean and your head will definitely stay warm and at the perfect temperature for cold weather conditions. The style is incomparable. This is the legendary gold standard in beanies and it shows with lack of visible seams or lumps or other misshapened oddities that you find with cheaper made but just as or more costly beanies. If you want to look good, look no further than the ultimate styling that this Wigwam Men's beanie has, in spades!

Recommended for:

 - Keeping your head warm
 - Looking like a bad a$$
 - Safe cracking, dock working, sea captaining, after surf or ski sylishness
 - Hiding your baldness
 - Making all the girls swoon
 - Being the hippest hipster
 - Fighting bears and looking cool doing it

Not Recommend for;

 - Summers in Cancun
 - Being the only thing you wear in a sauna
 - Slaving over a hot grill
 - Deep sea diving, except to warm up your noggin once you have ascended from the briny depths

5,"I absolutely love these boots.  I wear this type in autumn to gather 24 boxes of kindling in the woods and the soles are a perfect 'gripper' for solid footing on the forest floor.  The fit of these boots were right on.  I thought I'd have to stretch them a bit to be comfortable - not so.  I wear a size 9 and ordered size 9 - perfect fit first time I tried them on.  Had no trouble pulling them on either.  Real suede with the softer, rubbery gripper soles are not easy to find.  I was thrilled to discover these and am even more thrilled that they're so perfect.  Hope they never run out of stock!",Perfect for the woods!

I liked the looks of these as well as the reviews and the price was about $25 less than on the Timberland website so I gave it a try. I've worn them twice so far. First day was a 12 hour day.

5,"After reading multiple reviews, I decided to go with the Extreme Arctic Biberalls. I need something to keep me warm in the deer stand and while working on vehicles outdoors in the winter. These appear to be built to the same standards that we all expect out of Carhartt. Zippers are heavy duty, insulation is thick and durable, plenty of pockets and snaps.

The material is super-stiff, but I think that after a month or two of heavy use, they'll become pliable to my liking. Some people complained of them being too bulky...I thought they were just fine. If you've ever worn coveralls or biberalls, you have to expect some restricted movement. Its the nature of the beast..

Sizing is much different than anticipated. Most reviews told me to order wider by 8"" and longer by 2""....WRONG... these Extreme Arctic's are composed of Polyester and Nylon only. These materials do not shrink up when washed/dried like the cotton-blend biberalls do.

To conclude, order yours the same length that you normally wear. You might go about 4"" wider in the waist to accommodate for under garments. Do not expect these to ""shrink-up"" because they won't and expect initial stiffness. Keep that in mind and you'll love these!!",Heavy Duty and Exact Fit.

I'm glad that I went with the 55mm, as they fit perfectly. Not only are they just right for my small face, but they look freakin' awesome. You can never go wrong with the classic that defined Tom Cruise and protected the eyes of the military long before Maverick took to the skies.

5,"I purchased both the black and the iridescent (gray metallic) in sizes 6.5 and 7 since I wasn't clear on the fit after reading the reviews. For me, my normal size 7 worked. In my opinion, the black leather was floppier / softer than the leather in the gray metallic. This made the black ones seem like it fit looser for me. I think the black, saddle, and nude colors are made of soft nappa leather and maybe the other colors are not. I'm just speculating there and don't know for a fact.

I've worn these shoes for about 2-3 weeks now, maybe 3-4 times a week, and they are so comfortable. I did like the snug fit of the iridescent ones on me vs the black ones. Given that these are made of leather, one should expect some variation as it's a natural material.

Incredible shoes. Somewhat of a timeless style. No toe cleavage for me. I really love them!",Tried on a few sizes and colors

I was worried when I read that you have to buy them a size and a half too big.  So I bought the first pair 2 sizes too big.  These shoes are so light and the fit is so adjustable I never noticed.  I danced and worked out, walked all day in them in comfort until I wore them out.  This time I got them a size and a half bigger than my size and I can't see why I'd ever buy another brand.

5,"My obsession with Minnetonka Moccasins is somewhat out of control. These (the Kilty Moc in brown) were my very first pair of Minnetonkas, and I absolutely love them! I ordered these in 2013 before a trip to Gettysburg. It was Spring, and I wanted shoes that weren't boots or sandals that I could wear on tours of museums and the battlefield. Luckily, I stumbled across these! I usually wear an 8-9 (usually 9 in boots that I want to wear heavier socks with). I ordered an 8 in these, and they fit pretty well but once they stretched a little (which didn't take long and I knew they would do) they were PERFECT! (I wore them the entire Gettysburg trip and walked for miles and miles in them.) I have since bought another pair of Kilty Mocs (in gray) and a pair of the Deerskin Mocs, which are my absolute favorite! (The Moosehide Mocs are my next purchase, they are even more amazing than the Deerskin Mocs!) I wear Minnetonkas ALL the time, to all kinds of places (they've been all around Chicago, the Adirondacks, and the New York State Fair, just to name a few).

That said, these are fantastic slippers. The wool is thick and luxurious, and after a couple weeks of regular wear they feel like they were made for my feet.

5,"I bought this watch because:

1. it uses light as a source of power;

2. it can synchronize with the atomic clock in Colorado automatically using radio wave;

3. it was on sale here for $63.5 shipped around 2005 X'mas. (I did have to pay ~$8 to have the watch band adjusted locally.)

I am completely satisfied with this watch so far. It was so accurate that I can tell whether my PC's clock is off.

It sync'ed with the atomic clock every night (I am in NJ), not a miss so far.

5,CASUAL AND DRESSY AT THE SAME TIME AND COMFORTABLE TOO....,GREAT FIND...
5,"As I was shopping for a new watch, I had a certain number of criteria in mind.

1.  It must be affordable
2.  It must be from a recognized brand (for quality purposes)
3.  It must be stylish without being too fad-ish
4.  It must be multi-purpose and lend itself to almost all
  styles of dress, be it casual or formal.

I found all of this in this little Seiko watch.  At first, I was setting my sights on a no-battery type of design, but after reading about both kinetic and solar watches...and finding out that both do require replacement of either a lithium ion battery or capacitor, neither of which were guaranteed to last longer than a regular battery operated watch...I decided to stick with the regular quartz.

The watch itself looks better than its picture.  The dial is listed as white on the website, but it's actually a silver tone...similar to what you see on Rolex brands (which it's supposed to mimic).  The gold has a nice shine to it, with particular sparkle coming from the marked hours and the pie-cut bezel around the watch face.  There is luminous material on the watch hands and hour markers, but a very minimal amount.  My guess is that they didn't want to detract from the shiny finish, but you do lose some ability to see the watch face at night.  There's enough to see the watch hands...just barely...but the hours are really hard to make out in the dark.  Oh well, if checking the time at night is a real issue then I suggest looking at some Timex Indiglos. ***REVISION*** While it is hard to see the luminous hands and markers at first, they do get brighter once your eyes adjust to the dark.  I found myself waking up early this morning and could clearly see all the marked hours and hands of my watch face with no problems.

This watch also comes with a day and date calendar.  Some have said it's hard to work, but I actually found it to be really easy.  The instructions are very easy to follow and I had the calendar and time set up in about 2 minutes.

This watch is surprisingly lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  The catch opens without breaking any nails off and the band is very roomy.  I have a medium to large sized wrist and wear my watch in a slightly loose ""bracelet"" style, but I still had to get a couple of links taken out.

My verdict:  a good watch at a good price.  It goes with everything in my closet and is from a company that's known for excellence and durablility.  Five Stars!

P.S. When I wrote this view, the price was not the same as what it's being sold for now. So my stance that it was very affordable was not untrue(as it was at the time).",Chic without being too pricey

5,"I just had a total hip replacement 3 months ago and was told I needed lots of walking. I'm only 39 btw. I have a slight pronation and was looking for a walking shoe that would help. The research I did suggested this shoe.  I also have high arches and although some reviews noted needing arch supports, I have found no such need.  I'm not used to full leather shoes so they're a bit heavier than I am used to, but not uncomfortably so. So far they have been comfortable enough, and I'm allowing some lower comfort level because they are new and need to be broken in. I recommend measuring the width of your foot to see if you might need wide shoes. I have never felt that I have wide feet but my last pair of sauconys ripped on the sides as they were made of very thin mesh. Turned out according to their chart I needed a wide show and I'm happy I measured first. Overall it's a great walking shoe.",Great sturdy walking shoe

These are just that: snug but definitely not too tight.  They're comfortable and breathable.  I definitely wanted slippers to wear all around the house that would keep my feet warm but not sweaty, and these do the trick.  They're not very attractive or anything, so if cuteness factor is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere.

I bought some less expensive but supposedly big brand socks along the way - they are horrible, every one.  Back up socks - not for when I mean business.

5,"Hamilton is a very old and respected U.S. watchmaker although after being bought up by the swiss, they use swiss movements. I selected and purchased this automatic to have a really nice (elegant, simple, not too thick, classic) watch without spending a ton. At just over $400, this was a bargain. Although it comes with a metal bracelet, you can remove it and replace it with a leather strap yourself (just need some fine tools). I'm using it now with a black or brown leather strap with a deployment clasp. Watch is highly recommended for anyone looking for a classic, aviator/military/simple style. One more thing: when you get an automatic self winding watch, most today seem to be really thick(to house the mechanism plus autowinder). This one isn't. I have thin wrists and at a diameter of 42mm and a thickness of just under 10mm, this watch is a perfect fit.",Excellent watch at a great price
5,"I love these shoes. Their durability and comfort are awesome. Leather makes the difference with my girl's sweating feet.
they met my expectations.",Quality says it all!
5,Love this bag. Holds a lot of stuff and of course it lives up to Maxpedition's reputation for durability. I have been carrying it for a few weeks now and there is plenty of room for my little tablet in it's soft case as well as loads of books and other stuff. Could have a few more organizational pockets inside but still a great bag. It even keeps my stuff dry in the rain.,Love this bag
5,Great color for the season,Five Stars
5,"I ordered these for my 18 year old who surprisingly decided to wear something other than tennis shoes at his request. He told me what size to get, which made me nervous, but he said he had tried on two of his friend's shoes... and deduced that this was the size he needed. Scary... BUT darned if they didn't fit perfectly and he is thrilled with them. He wore them three days later for a period of 10 hours walking around Washington DC as part of a birthday celebration. He said they were extremely comfortable, no blisters and was very happy!  I am very happy with the quality and can see him wearing them for quite a few years since his foot has finally stopped growing.",Great Fit and Quality
5,Provides great support. Easy to use. Would recommend to other buyers. I would buy again should I need to order some more.,Proflex 1650 Back Support
5,"I tried these on in a store before I ordered them. I'm a 34"" waist and ordered the 38"" waist so I could wear them over my cloths and still move comfortably. If you buy your waist size, they fit really snug. Too snug to work in for me. The store only had brown, so I came online to get the black pair. They are warm in below zero weather and stand up well to bucking hay bales. Great Carhartt quality.",Awesome product!

5,"I ordered this pair of Levi 511 pants in the Cimmaron color. They look somewhat different than what I expected, but are still overall a nice pair of pants. I was expecting more a brown/tobacco color, and they look somewhat olive in my opinion. I ordered this pair of pants in 32x30. 32 in. waist is a little big for me but I usually order one size up in case they shrink. These pants feel a little more stiff than other Levi 511's I own, but I think that a few washes should take care of that. Levi 511 is my all time favorite fit of pants/jeans. Not exactly boot cut, not exactly slim fit, just a nice tapered look!",My new favorite pair!
5,I liked these so much that I went back and bought the black and beige too. They fit great and are very comfortable.,terrific
5,"This is my absolute favorite shirt!
For reference... I am large-busted and long-waisted so this shirt just baaaaarely skims my bum and is definitely more of a shirt than a tunic on me.

5,Just what i wanted. Fit perfect,Fit perfect
5,"These are expensive trunks; for the price of one pair, you could buy almost an entire week's worth of cotton boxer briefs or trunks.

That said, they are the most comfortable, most supportive and just plain aesthetic underwear you can buy. They do not ""loosen"" as cotton ones tend to, and stay tight all day. In addition, they are surprisingly breathy so you never feel stifled; on the exact opposite side of the spectrum, they are actually quite warm by themselves, making them fairly ideal for temperature regulation.

In addition to feeling comfortable and relaxted, you might catch yourself looking in the mirror and strut off with your chest puffed out.

EDIT: Update Feb 2017 - The Black and Dark Blue colors of this underwear have performed perfectly and beyond my expectations; however, the Mink Gray has come up short. After much fewer wash cycles, the gray had begun to ball and thin, and now, two years later, have torn. I suspect the fabric is slightly different in the grays because both my pair did this, whereas the black and dark blue were completely unharmed.",Expensive and worth the cost
5,I bought this sandal as a gift since I have one myself and love the style as well as the look.  Totally love it and would recommend to anyone that like to wear sandal.,Great sandal

The transaction went very well.  I received the boots in 3-4 days after placing the order.,Very Good Quality Boots
5,"These are your basic, good quality gold toe but in a size generous but not swimming, bought for my 13 year old with size 12 feet!  I washed them hot and dried them hot to get the worst of any shrinking done before this review - how many times have you bought socks that were HALF their size after the first wash and dry cycle?  Well, these were generous afterwards, but not too big for his size 12 length but still thin feet.  I'd say they just fit at 12 (on the border of being a scootch too large, that is).  I like the weight and quality, they are mid weight everyday socks that could be used with casual dress shoes or even black athletic shoes.  Probably too thick for fine dress shoes for most upscale men, though.","Finally, socks that aren't stretched over a man's foot"

5,"I lost some weight and needed to buy new bras. The bra style that I loved and had been very happy with is no longer in production (no demand?). It took three attempts to actually find a bra that was comfortable and didn't make me look as if I just had one large lump where my boobs should be. Why is it that most bras these days have padding? I am a 36D and really do not need, or want to look any larger. Anyway, this bra works on all levels, so much so that I ordered four each in white and black.",Success at last!

5,"I am somewhat of a Minnetonka mocc connoisseur, I have at least 10 pairs. I still have and wear the first pair I bought 4 years ago. They are durable and go with many outfits from jeans to dresses. Over time as your moccs stretch out enough to fit an insole you might think about adding some arch support but I travel in these moccs and can walk 10+ miles a day no problem without insoles. I wear them sans socks too. I usually spray fresh moccs with some kind of water protectant when I first get them and they hold up a long time and I live in wet Seattle.","comfy, cute, & durable"

I also suggest if your going to buy the BDU pants with this to stick with the same manufacturer so the patterns match and the same material is used for both pants and jacket.

Excellent ankle support and toe support.  I can't talk enough about the toe support.  When you're leaping from rock to rock or you're walking up a half mile hill in shin and ankle busting conditions these are the shoes you want.  Usually under what conditions these boots saved my toes countless times in addition to being very solid on the outside, had zero torn leather.

5,"I absolutely LOVE the design and scent of these. I was soooooo pleasantly surprised when I received my first one. They're truly a rich, all-natural cedar! The only downside is that they seem a tad large to me. They didn't fit into some of my smaller shoes. (Though, they fit fine in some of my larger shoes, so maybe I'm just a freak.)

I ended up ordering an additional one in the smaller size, and may order another even smaller set. I think it really depends on the design of the shoe. ""One size doesn't fit all,"" in this case. ; )","Great! Fights Odor, Too!"

For some styles, I find a 39 reg is a better fit and for other styles the 38 R is fine.  Fortunately returns are easy to do and exchanges are quick.  The shoe is very comfortable --- roomy toe box, soft suede that shapes your foot, most are adjustable. I have a high arch and these shoes with the toe bar give excellent support.

They are a bit warm for full summer heat in Arizona 110 but they still get worn every day. I wear out my boots very quickly usually having to replace between 9-12 months or sooner. I've worn these almost every day for around 9 months and have a huge amount of life left. But whats even better is when they wear out, I can send them back to Danner and have them reconditioned and resoled. Love and highly recommend these boots",Best boots in the world!!!

5,"This watch is great. It is my second Eco-Drive, so that says something there. This watch is lightweight extremely comfortable.  I absolutely love it.

I will attempt to answer some of the issues that people have said that they have with it.

Firstly let me tell you that once you purchases the watch new, that you immediately go to Citizen's web site and register the watch. That way should the unforseen happen after Amazon's 30 day grace has expired you are covered.  Yes if you do send it to Citizen you will pay for shipping.

Issue: The crystal is easily scratched! The crystal is a mineral crystal. It will scratch. The other alternatives are sapphire which will not scratch BUT will shatter far easier than mineral. The other is acrylic, better known as plastic. It scratches and shatters easily. Also after time it will get to where you have trouble seeing through it.
Issue: The crown and stem came out! Now at any factory in the world, there are always going to be a few duds that slip out. But most likely you were pulling on the crown far harder than you needed to, or you used pliers intentionally breaking it.
Issue: The watch died in less than a year! Again sometimes duds escape the factory. Were you smart enough to register your watch, or are you a dud too?
Issue: The band is too short or uncomfortable!  If it is too short, please by all means put a different band on it. NATO straps offer endless customizability,  are durable, and very inexpensive alternatives.  If the band is uncomfortable please try wearing it for a week or two to break it in (like shoes). If this doesn't help, put a different band on it. This is very easy to fix.
Issue: My watch doesn't glow like an Indiglo! That is because it is not an Indiglo! The hour markers and hands will glow in the dark after only a few minutes exposure to light, it is called luminescence.
Issue: Why can't I set the time, day, or date anytime I want? Between the hours of 9pm and 4am the movement inside the watch is in the process of adjusting the day and date to the next day. If you adjust it during this period, though unlikely,  you could damage the movement by causing undue stress during this time. Just go to bed and adjust it in the morning.

Issue: The seconds hand does not hit every minute/second marker perfectly!  First, this is not a sweeping seconds hand. Second this is a quartz movement (solar but still quartz). This is a common issue with quartz watches. I have them do this in all price ranges.

Issue: My watch got ate by a radioactive chinchilla with horrible gas! Ummm.... I got nothin...

For almost every single issue that you could have with this watch, use your warranty! That is what its there for.

Issue: You're a d!@k! I may be, but I'm not the idiot that neglected to register my watch!",An Affordable Watch At Its Best

I slip them into my shoes when I get home, and by the next morning my shoes are ready to go. These are spring-loaded, but I haven't noticed them stretching out any of my shoes.

The extra panel in the panty is what makes the fit so comfortable.  I do find that I need to purchase a size larger than what the chart says I need, so I think that they run a little small.

5,"If your going to be lifting then you can benefit from using one of these.  The suspenders don't do anything other than allow you to wear it without having it velcroed shut.  Once you do strap it on the side elastic panels pull forward and really allow solid support.  I use it when I have to haul a wheel chair up a flight of stairs with a person in it.  Before I would suffer back spasms afterwards, and now I don't. Simple as that.  Well made for a great price.  Be sure to use the size conversion table to ensure you get the right one for you.  I have 36"" waist and the Large works well for me.  Hope that helps.",Works very well

5,"I have now tried several models or styles of Dickies Men's Pants. I must say I have been very pleasantly surprised every time! First, the price is definitely right. Check to see the seller and shipper every time you look up a style and size as they may change. Although 4 of the 5 orders I placed were sold and shipped by Amazon, one was sold and shipped by Elite Hero, a Market Place vendor. In this case all worked out very well as I had no problems whatsoever with any shipment or product and in the case of Elite Hero they proactively followed up to be sure all was well with my order which was the case. I like these jeans because they are not ""baggy"" yet they are soft and comfortable to wear and feel. I would say they are roomy for their size. They do not feel like a real stiff canvass type material as some jeans do. These jeans and all Dickies products look, feel and wear as though they are well made and made to last. I will buy more for myself and as gifts for others and appreciate that Dickies is proving an excellent product can be made without sticker shock.",Just Right and then Some!

5,"These pants are very good quality and seem like they are made of very sturdy material. They are like a pair of pink camouflage ones I had bought awhile back. I still have them too and they are my favorites. The pants fit great at the waist as they are slightly lo-rise. This means they do not go nearly up to your chest. The waist area does not have any belt loops, but has a tie instead. So if you want to carry a belt-clip cell phone you still can if you tie it tight enough, or just carry the phone in one of the pockets. For me I find I can tie it enough to hold a cell phone and be comfortable (and I am one that can't have a lot of tightness in the waist area). This style of pants fit my expectations. These are meant to be loose to slightly baggy around the hips and thighs. I am 5'4 at 127 lbs and normally take a size medium. I ordered a size medium and they fit me really well. The legs are a little long but you can use the ties in the bottom seams to tie them up to the length you need. I highly recommend these pants as they are stylish, and are great for nearly any season (except summer as these are made of medium-weight material). In winter in the Northeast you may want to use long underwear with these in coldest months. Amazon sent these quickly and they arrived quickly. Definitely a great value for the price. I ordered several pair in different colors!","Great Quality, Comfortable and Great Fit."

5,"i got these in the 8220 Blue Pu and they are just so pretty.  i read over the other reviews, and on their advice, even though i usually order a size 7.5, i got the size nine ... and the fit was actually pretty good, with room for a ladies' dress shoe gel insert.  So, i was happy.

In the blue color these just go wonderfully with just about any shade of blue denim miniskirt or jeans.  Coordinating a top might prove challenging, because one doesn't want ""overkill"", but i did pair these with a blue denim mini-dress that i usually pair with white pumps or white sandals, and the effect was really very pretty and sexy.

Be warned, ladies, these heels are quite high, so if you're not used to walking in four or even five inch heels, you might want to start with something a little less challenging.  However, if you're like me and you wear high heels a lot, these don't present much difficulty, especially if you put a gel insert in.

The Casio waveceptor is 1. beautiful, 2. pretty light in weight, 3. 3 alarms, 4. a few other features which did not count in my criteria. 5. The solar recharging is cool...Batteries that run forever, what a concept. 6. A big plus...it sets itself by the time standard via radio.

All and all, it's the watch I've been looking for and it's nice enough to wear to the symphony.",Excellent watch for the money

Not a single pair has faded from sun or repeat washings either. I order another pair every chance I get!",Great hard-working scrub pant

Since no 9N exists for exchange, I'll keep them, wear them indoors without socks, and hope that they eventually give a little in length.  The width is as good as it gets for my AAA feet.",Super true to size!

Much much better than any sandal slippers I've used in the past.",Size Large fits great

5,"This is the standard playtex bra I have been buying for years with the exception it is no longer made in the USA.  There is a difference in quality depending upon where it is manufactured but compared to other bras I have tried, it is still one of the best especially for larger sizes.  The straps are nice as they don't ""cut"" into my shoulders. Very nice support for being a wireless bra which after numerous bad experiences I try not to buy anymore.

A plus for me as I am very short the straps adjust up and stay where I put them.  Many of the other bras I have tried adjust down and end up being to long to put the girls where they should be.

Over a certain size they give you 4 hooks which is really nice and cuts down on the band shifting.

The only down side is I refer to this bra as my ""lunch room lady bra.""  It is sturdy, dependable and gets the job done but lacks frills.

Held up well to washing and line drying (repeated drying in a dryer does not work well with these)","Same bra, great price"

5,"I wear nothing else and needed a new pair of boot cut. I might start wearing something else if Levi doesn't do something about what's going on with its labor force. C'mon Levi! You're charging enough for each pair of these things. Spread it around to those who make them for you. Had to be said.

I really might never buy them again after recent news, but you want only to know about the jeans. They're Levi's, which, despite Brett Favre's claims, are still the best, albeit overpriced.

Mainly, I can always count on them fitting, and once again these do. Best for me this time is the 35"" waist, which is unusual for Levi's.",Count on Levi's

5,"I use this backpack purse every time I travel. I love it! It is surprisingly more spacious than it looks, although it is not huge, by any means. I can fit in a small water bottle, my wallet, phone, and small guidebook. It has zippers both on the front outside (I put tissues and other papers there) and the back outside (I put my camera there). It is slightly padded, but not bulky. The material can not be easily cut or slit. The zippers are sturdy. It is also very washable. I really like to wear a backpack when I travel so my hands are free, and this looks much better than any other backpack purse I've seen. Totally recommend it if you don't need too much room.",Love it for travelling!

5,"This bra hardly needs another 5-star review.  I LOVE this bra for days spent at home or around town.  It doesn't have enough padding to prevent nipples from showing - so I have to wear a slightly padded bra for my air-conditioned office.  I'm so happy to have found a comfortable bra that I can wear at home, or when I don't want the extra padding of my work bras.  I'm a 34DD, which is a difficult size to fit.  This bra runs a little small around the band, and a little large in the cup size.  I might try a 36D.

I did notice the ""scratchy"" feeling a few others have mentioned.  I mostly noticed it right when I put it on; after a few minutes I forgot about it.  It has gotten better after a few weeks of wear.",Great bra for comfy days at home

Let alone the bar eventually will break one the front not allowing the bag to stand right. So back to what I know works!  Great product. Other reviews state it falls over at times, its a balancing act...if you have too many files/computer on one side, yes it will fall over. But if you leave the handle up it will balance it out :-) Cords and mouse fit in the front compartment just fine.  Must buy!",Love this bag

It's countdown timer is perfect for brief reminders since you don't even have to look at it while you are setting the timer for 1,3,5 10,15,20,or 30 minutes (it's audible). And the watch is fairly indestructible. So how much would you pay for a watch that does so much easily?  Oh, that's the best part...it's cheap.  But it lasts and lasts.  The only con is that when the battery goes 2-3 years down the road, you have to get another watch.  But at this price, that's OK.  I have owned this model for over 15 years.  It went out of production briefly but was brought back quickly when every fan hollered.

These reviewers weren't kidding around!  This brand's ballet pink is SALMON.  Much more orange than pink going on.  Alrighty!  The darker than I'm used to salmon - er - ballet pink looks fine with my daughter's plain black leotard.  Once she has them on the color is slightly less striking.  I don't think this particular color looks as good with the light pastel leotards my daughter wears vs. the Body Wrappers tights in ballet pink that she has.  I'm happy with my purchase, but beware if you don't have dance wear options to match up with orangish-pink tights.  Regardless, the tights are of good quality and thick so that my daughter can be on the floor without worry of snagging her tights.",Ballet Pink - NOT the color standard in this brand.

It looked a bit cheap so I wasn't expecting much, but it actually looked really nice on him and it held up very well. The cape was a bit annoying to him and the velcro was rubbing on his neck so he did take some issue with that. He decided to have a wrestling match with his cousins after trick-or-treating and ended up with grass stains, I figured they wouldn't come out but again I was surprised when they did. All in All great costume and the size fit my 6 almost 7 year old perfectly, he normally wears a 7/8.",Superman Costume worked for us!

5,"Carhardtt is my favorite clothing. Utility, quality, durability, comfort. All what I've come to expect from their products. They haven't let me down yet. I work on rooftops doing solar installations and these things allow for good range of movement while keeping my core and legs very warm. coupled with a wool underlayer, a hoodie and a carhardtt jacket, I am comfortable in temperatures well below freezing. The pants have started to wear through in some areas that frequently come into contact with the roof shingle (knees, side of right calf) but thats to be expected. roof shingles chew clothing and shoes up. I am going to reinforce the areas that have abrasions with patches.

The shirts come in other colors other than white which makes my husband happy because he prefers colored shirts rather than white.

5,"I wore these while walking the Camino in Spain. They were great, held up well and comfortable. I only got one small blister and that was a surprise. I walked 6-8 hours a day 12-18 miles a day. I never even changed socks during the day (I know you should air your feet but had no issues).

The socks were very comfortable and kept my feet dry. The design seemed to allow for flextion of the foot without stress. They did not shrink when washed. They took a little time to dry but if they were wet in the morning i would just hang from my pack. I took two pair, one to wear and one to wash. I wish the ad would be better to figure the size. I wear a 10 1/2 shoe and a correct size sock is 13, so check that out before you purchase. Also, you should wear the socks when you try out your boots or hikers.",Loved my Thorlo socks

5,The Skagens are beautiful watches they are 5mm thin; if you like a thin watch that is upscale but but less than $200 - this is the deal. I own 7 skagens and they all have a good look. I am partial to the titanium - you need to be careful with the darker titaniums they can get nicked and I will need to replace a band on my copper/brown one in a year or so. I hope they continue the line with new styles and maybe we can make it to 4mm. I had to return one for a loose 2nd hand. Amazon is not shipping these properly - they have air pillows on top and the watch on the bottom - not a good setup. The air pillows need to go around the whole watch.,Skagen's are the Best

5,"I've had this for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it.  It's so light weight and thin while still holding the assortment of cards that I need.

When I'm wearing dress pants it goes easily into my front pocket, as it advertises.  When I'm wearing jeans, I prefer to keep it in the back, simply because I'd rather have my keys and cell phone in the front.  Either way, it's comfortable and light.

If you are the kind of person who carries a lot of cash, this wallet is probably not for you.  If you live off your debit card like I do, I couldn't recommend it more highly.  That said, it will hold 5-10 bills before it starts to feel overloaded.  The cash pocket is very ""shallow"", so if you don't tuck the cash in all the way it will stick out the top.  Again, not a problem if you don't use much cash.

I'm going to order another one after I write this review just so I'll have it ready when it's time to retire my current iteration.",Amazing if you prefer a slim wallet

5,"I bought these for a trip to Alaska and they were great.  I was able to wear my comfortable walking shoes and have these handy when it started to rain.  They pack up very small - I could fold up two pairs and put them in my backpack along with my DSLR, a mini tripod, and a small umbrella.

As for sizing - I tried three - Small, Medium, and Large.  First, they are pretty stretchy.  Just as a test I was able to force the small over a size 9 Ecco dress shoe with a relatively thick rubber sole.  On that same shoe, the medium was just right and the large was too roomy - I had about a half-inch of extra space all around.  On my trip I used them over a pair of size 9 New Balance MX10's.  They are minimal shoes but have a thick padded collar around the ankle.  The medium fit perfectly around the sole and toe area, but were a tad snug around the ankle where the padding was - it didn't constrict, but my foot did not slide in as easy as with dress shoes.

Overall, a great value and great travel rain boots.",Great for travel in wet weather.

5,"The Bates Ultra-Lites are leaps and bounds more comfortable than my previous Bellevilles (which were chosen for me), and they came from Plus More Inc quickly and at a great price.  I have a very wide foot that the previous 10.5W didn't accommodate very well, this boot does just fine.  The sole is also significantly softer to walk on (though that's partially due to the cushioned insole it comes with), and snow/ice traction is good.

Sizing: I wear a 10.5 4E in Asics and New Balance shoes, and this 10.5EW fits me fine

Minor cons: There were a couple of pressure points on my shin and on top of my feet that fixed themselves during the first few hours of wear.  I don't have a lot of confidence in the zipper over the long-term.  They are made in China, if that bothers you, but I don't see any glaring problems with build quality.

By the way, at first I couldn't figure out how to get my foot past the ankle area using only the zipper for access.  The trick is to twist your heel slightly so that it's occupying the open zipper, then pull the back of the boot on.  The forefoot will have a wider opening to go through, and it'll straighten out as it goes on.  They're not puddle-resistant, because there are although there hasn't been any damage to the suede from snow.

So far, 4 days, 48 hours of wear, on my feet for about half that, and everything is great.  If they last 2000 hours, I'll buy another pair in a heartbeat.

I have tried eight other brands over the years, but have come back time and again to the Altitude IV's.
I have noticed a change, since they started making them in China.  The shoes run smaller than before so I have less toe room.  I ordered a pair a half size larger and it seemed to be more like the earlier boots.  I also noticed that the eyelet hooks are not as well finished as the earlier boots, so the laces get cut by sharp edges within a month sometimes, on the boots made in China.  I've had to file them on the last two pairs.  I shouldn't have to buy replacement shoe laces in a month of buying a new pair of boots.  Still, with my bad feet, this is the only pair of boots that work for me, so I always keep a new pair in the box, as a backup, just in case they discontinue this model.  I'll just order it a half size larger, from now on.","Great boots, but with some caveats."

5,"Been getting these for years; arrived quickly, great price; seems like they designed it a little different; footbed not as pillowy, however, I feel it gives me more stability; it is still really comfy; also, it runs about an inch shorter, taken off the top, so that's ok, too, as the top always had extra room ( a lot); so, there are changes, but I think they're good changes; these usually last about a year anyway - stopped washing, breaks down faster

5,"The Timberland PRO Men's 81016 Gorge MPO Steel Toe shoes are a favorite for my husband. This would be his 3rd pair in the past few years. With his line of work he his on his feet all day and needs not only the comfort but the steel toe protection as it is a requirement. I have purchased other brands that have only lasted a month or two and have been uncomfortable. Therefore he now only will wear this style and brand if it isn't Timberland then he won't even bother putting them on. The Timberland PRO Men's 81016 Gorge usually last him 6 months - a year. That is with enduring the outdoor elements, automotive grease and hydraulic fluid.",... Men's 81016 Gorge MPO Steel Toe shoes are a favorite for my husband
5,"These pants are super comfy! The legs are a little wide for me, but the waist and hip areas fit well. For reference: I'm 5'7"" and usually a size 22/24 and I carry slightly more weight around the middle, but I'm big all over. I've spent WEEKS searching for the right scrubs for my new position because it's rough trying to find cute yet comfortable scrubs for someone my size. These really fit the bill! They have stretch and the fabric is very soft. The cut on the seat and legs is loose enough to keep from showing any lumps and bumps bigger gals might have. My biggest decision factor is that I can bend over without my pants sliding halfway down my behind!! The stiff cotton scrubs I wore for school would slide down just walking up steps. Another note: I took a chance on these because they are drawstring in the front and elastic in the back; I needed to cinch my old pants really tight to keep them up, but there is plenty of give which negates that need. I'm really very pleased with these pants; they are more comfortable than my pajamas! I raved about these pants so much that some of my former classmates also bought them. They are all different sizes from xs to 3x and no one has anything negative to say. I highly recommend.",Bailey scrub pants: so fantastic!!

These are the most comfortable pair of shoes I think I've ever had.  They are a little wider then then whispers but also just a little heavier.  But out of the two this one was my go to sandal.

I exclusively wore this pair at Disney for 14 days without a blister and without my feet feeling tooooo tired considering how much we were walking.  I now have 2 pairs and will most likely pick up another one as they go down in price.

The pockets are lined with regular jeans pocket material, if you're concerned about the fleece pockets in the fleece version (worried about keys punching holes?). On the other hand it's nice to have the warmth of the fleece-lined version for when I stuck my hands in the fleece pockets. I was comfortable wearing these inside and out when it was single-digit temperatures, but when it got to the 20s outside it was too warm wearing them inside. REALLY nice having them when it gets really cold. May cause you to forget you have a regular shirt on and you might go outside without a jacket - a bad idea if it's really cold.",Warmer than the Fleece Lined version

The waist (34) was fine over my regular clothe but 28 is still too long when the straps are adjusted to where they fit comfortable at the crotch. If the straps are tightened all the way it tightens the bibs at the crouch and makes it very uncomfortable and the front part of the bibs rub your chin. I look for a source where I can order a custom fit set but to no avail. I tried washing them in hot water to see if they would shrink but this material won't shrink.

5,"I have been buying these pants for several years now. I do recommend them as a business casual dress pant for the following reasons:

-They are 100% cotton, so they are not excessively hot like synthetic fabrics.
-There is a stain-repellent treatment on the front which does cause coffee and water to bead off. This tends to degrade with dry cleaning.
-They only need to be tumbled for a few minutes and then lightly pressed in order to be presentable.
-They are very loose around the butt and hips, which is good if you work out and need some extra room.
-They are suitable for church and work, and the neutral colors go with every shirt.
-They are very comfortable to wear all day.

The cons:

-The stitching around the pockets may loosen up with a lot of use.
-On some people I could imagine they could appear too loose and this may contribute to a messy appearance.

I rotate between 4-5 pairs of this pant every week. I would say once every six months I will have to replace one because of staining or wear. Overall due to the comfort and fit I will continue to buy them regularly.",I buy these pants regularly

5,"This is a great pack.
I researched a lot. over 60 and the reviews are right.
Lots of pockets.
Great Zippers.
Has a bottom zipper that holds a rain cover. Room for a small umbrella too. These protect my computer when I sit the backpack down.
Has 2 draw pulls to tighten it up if you have it overloaded and need to squeeze it to fit in the check in tester at the airlines.
The single bottle holder works fine. I have a tall one so I use the compression strap to secure when I'm not using it.
There is a small logo strap on the shoulder strap that I can slip my sunglasses earpiece through. That's nice.
It also has a small waist belt I can use if I'm really active or loaded down. The shoulder straps and the waist belt have a panel that covers them.
I'm very happy with it.
Only thing that is weird is the very small pouch that velcros to the shoulder strap. It's way to small for phone. Not long enough for sunglasses.
All the rest is the best.",A Great Backpack

5,"Carhart's are what I wear when I am off duty. I have a pair of double knee dungarees Carharts that is about 18 years old.  They are not pretty anymore.. They my saved my leg a long time ago while cutting a tree down.  The chainsaw kicked up and hit my leg. The front layer was cut. The second layer was not. I will never get read of that pair. The pants are so old they are almost white. They are stained and have enormous about of character,  if you know what I mean. I Love Carhart. I Love the pockets. Easy to get my big hands in and out of, side pockets are great for anything that fits inside. I believe Carhart needs a web site to search for the oldest pair still in existence and they should be place in the Smithsonian. I have about ten pair of Carharts.  I LOVE EM. Want wear anything else for outside work, farm, ranch, yard, fishing, hunting, cutting trees, digging ditches, building houses what ever your doing. They look good to for the first ten years.

5,"I got this watch about a year and a half ago and i have to say I love it. I've received many compliments on from friends and coworkers. As a child I loved watches and would always look at them in the department stores, but being a child I was only trusted with Timex digital watches, which killed my love for timepieces. Years later I found myself walking though the mall when the watches of a jewelry store caught my eye and it instantly renewed my love. I wanted a watch that was simple yet classy, without being cheap, and thats exactly what this is. The solid black face with reflective hands and hour markers have a rather stunning appearance without being cluttered with excessive dials (I usually know what month it is, and I'm not a pilot so I didn't want a cluttered watch). The hour markers are raised, with angled sides, such that they catch the light different at different angles. I still find myself sometimes being distracted by it if it catches the light just right. I'd say that it looks better in person than the picture here, which makes it look flat and dull. The case is polished stainless steel and the band is also stainless, but a fine brushed look (everything on this watch is nice and shiny). Naturally being a well made quartz watch it keeps time as good as, or even better than, any high end mechanical watch, and I've never had to reset it other than daylight savings and etc. I haven't been able to notice even a second of time loss over periods of months. I've been shopping for a while now for a dressier watch to expand my collection, but have yet to find anything I like as much as this watch and it is more than fine to wear for any special occasion. Jeweler at the store wanted $180+ for this exact watch. I'd recommend this watch if you want something that looks nice without being complicated","Great Watch, Good Style, Good Price"
5,"The only thing that matters when you are buying stockings is the price.  Is it cheaper to buy it at a department store like Kohls or JC penny with their 20-30% discount, or is it cheaper to find them on Amazon.  That is the real question.

The stocking itself, is nothing out of the ordinary.  But I do like the thigh highs.  I recommend buying a garter belt, because these rubber elastic bands around the thighs will wear out after one or two wears, and then, you can use the garter belt to keep on wearing them.",Stocking is stocking
5,"These are great fishnets! Fit well, don't create any bulges. As a tall person, it's hard to find leg wear that fits well, I'm 6' and 135lbs, and these fit me well, but would easily fit anyone taller or voluptuous...... hopefully that is somewhat helpful....Good quality as well!",Comfortable and great fit!

Good traction and makes for sure-footing outside, on hikes and the like. I didn't think it would be the best winter boot but there have been no complaints on cold snowy days regarding warmth. Obviously more time consuming to tie up than other boots so sometimes little ones don't want to take that time. A big difference from off brands is that the exterior holds up great, is of high quality and doesn't appear to ""scratch off"". Very happy and will buy the next larger size next year.

5,"I'm a nursing student so I'm required to wear white shoes with my white scrubs to clinicals. Because I'm on my feet all day, walking around hard hospital floors, I needed something wider than the white Nike's I had purchased as they were causing a lot of foot pain for me.

These shoes are BIG, and by big i don't just mean wide. While they are wide, as advertised, they also have a really high sole which adds and extra half-inch to an inch to your height. They aren't any heavier than the average tennis shoes but the sole is MUCH taller. I prefer a shorter sole that's closer to the ground but these things are so comfortable that I'll live with higher sole in exchange for the comfort!

So far, after several months of heavy duty use in a hospital setting, they are holding up quite well and I've noticed no splitting or cracking anywhere. The tread is also decent and even on slippery floors, I didn't feel like I was ready to start sliding or anything.

*** CONCLUSION ***

All in all, these are a great buy. It's hard to find wide shoes for those of us who need them and it's even harder to find them in pure white which is something required for certain jobs, schools, and professions. The price is on the higher side but you are getting a specialty shoe so I think the price is fair for what you're getting.

I try to present as much info as I can to help you make an informed decision about purchasing before you spend your hard-earned money on a product like this.

It fits my 10.5-month, 13th percentile son comfortably and I think I'll get at least 3-4 more months' use from it with regards to size. They are soft around the leg and waist openings, and the diaper isn't overly bulky. There fabric is soft, and the diaper is well made. You'll get a lot of swims out of it. Snaps on the left side make it easier to get baby in and out. After a number of swims and washes, the colours also seem to hold up nicely.","Fits perfectly, very soft and comfy."

5,"I operate a small farm and am on my feet all the time. I have worn orthotics for over 20 years....following foot surgery for bunions when I wasn't even a teenager yet. My feet hurt easily, and when my feet hurt, my back isn't far behind. And then come the headaches. It is so important for me to have quality footwear, but so often the price makes me hesitate. I'd been wearing a pair of insulated LL Bean boots for years. They were a gift from my husband for working in winter. My choices for outdoor work were tennis shoes or those Bean boots. Twice I stepped on nails that went through the Bean soles. Then I came up with a spare $100 and was determined to get myself good work boots. I read the reviews on all the women's steel toe boots. In farming it is always possible to be working around objects that want to wreck your toes. I just wanted to have a pair of boots that was appropriate for heavy duty environments. I worried about breathability...it gets over 100 degrees here in the summer. I am very grateful that I saw the reviews about NEEDING TO ORDER A SMALLER SIZE. I wear, technically, a US 7.5 but often find shoes that fit great that are size 8. Because of what I read, I ordered a size 7. This was a wise decision. They fit great and have a sense of roominess...like, if I was wearing hugely thick socks, the boots would still feel good. When my package arrived, I found that my orthotics fit easily into the boot without needing to remove the manufacturer's sole liner. If I cared much about such things, I'd mention that they look really attractive as boots go. The stitching, the leather, it all has a look of quality. I put them on, laced them up, and went back to work. It was early afternoon on my heaviest workday of the week when they arrived. I wore them all day, including out into the field rows at 105 degrees. My feet didn't get sweaty. The shoes felt sturdy on the uneven terrain and dirt clods. There was no chafing or rubbing or the least irritation. I kept feeling like I was walking on shock absorbers....I've never had an enclosed shoe be this comfortable. I kept them on until 10pm, when I decided I'd seen enough....my feet never started hurting. I am thrilled with my purchase and am recommending them to other femaile farmers and ranchers...all the reviews about them being comfortable right out of the box were spot on. My only tiny disappointment was that these were made in China. Cat is known for still manufacturing equipment stateside, and I had hoped I was supporting a job in America. Oh well, can't have everything.
Update: 5/03/13  I've now owned these boots for awhile, and they are still the most comfortable boots of this kind I've ever had for work. However, over the past few weeks, the outside stitching where the leather panels meet just past the steel toe box has come apart on each boot. This doesn't seem normal based on how I use the boots, and the same spot shouldn't fail in both places on each boot. Unfortunately the disintegrated stitches now allow water and dirt into the boot, and make for some discomfort as the leather panels no longer match up quite right. It took me a few weeks to find the time, but I have just contacted the manufacturer's customer service about the problem. I sent in detailed information and photos, as requested. To be continued....","So, so happy!"

5,"I love this combination of earrings.  I bought this for myself and I love each pair, each for their own value.  Each is a unique shape-and fairly substantial in content.  The colors of most of the gems is very bright- bright green for the peridot; rich gold for the citron; clear red for the garnet...the blue is light medium for the blue topaz , but the amethyst is in the pink-lavender range, not bad but not really the purple one might think of for amethyst.  Each stone in the earring is a nice size for an earring...it sits nicely in the middle of an earlobe and does not weigh heavily or lean forward when wearing it.  I also have to add, in these days when many of us are buying jewelry with sterling silver instead of gold because of the economy, each pair of earrings comes with a little anti-tarnish sheet in its individual box, to keep it fresh.  I think that is a nice touch.  I have yet to see any tarnish in my pieces, and I think it will help.  As some have mentioned in previous reviews, each pair of earrings come in their own special box, and they are perfect if one wants to give each pair separately.  Again, I love all of these earrings as they are a great addition to my wardrobe and I plan to wear them all because they are comfortable and way cute!",A very good purchase

5,I ordered this ring in a size four to wear on my pinkie-finger and it's just the most simply feminine little ring you could ask for at such a reasonable price. It shines beautifully. The one recommendation I would make is to check your ring sizes elsewhere.

4,"First of all, this jacket looks great and stylish. This would look good cruising city streets in cooler weather. The one thing I'd say it doesn't have going for it is the pockets. They're tiiiiny. I'm a small person (5'3"") and have small hands and they barely fit. There's no stashing your phone or keys in these pockets without losing them. There is an interior pocket that works great for that (on the left inside of the jacket) though. Just not as convenient. A product description would be nice too, amazon. It's hard to know exactly what you're buying from just pictures.

PROS:
Stylish
Warm
Detachable hood
Tab to keep sleeves rolled up
Cinch waist for slimming silhouette
Hidden pocket on left inside of jacket for valuables

CONS:
Very small hip pockets
No zipper on hip pockets
Hood is detachable, it doesn't fold into collar
Not lightweight and breathable for hot summer rainstorms
Inside pocket is rather small
Flap sewed on top of sleeves/shoulders that looks weird

So, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep the jacket, but I hope this review helps those out there who are looking for this kind of raincoat.",Cute but....
4,I have several of the Force Watches and always get complements on them. Was glad to see this model in their line as I needed something understated!,Fashionable
4,Great construction and quality.  Very comfortable and warm.  It fits snug in the front but over time I am sure it will fit better.  I would buy another one if they had one in 11 wide.,Small in the Front
4,"Let me preface this with my toes ate ALWAYS,  ALWAYS cold! With that said, I got these as a gift from my husband towards the end of last winter. Wore them around NYC in 30 weather with a pair of cozy socks and my toes never got cold.
The fit was perfect and I really love the look with any type of jeans.
My only cons are: the zipper can be difficult even if a pair of skinny jeans.  You need to hold both sides together. Also I don't care for the gap that occurs under the velcro strap. The top parts flap a bit and looks ugly. I know the intention is to wear these up or down but the folded down look is too sloppy for me. The zipper should be all the way to the top.
Would be 5 stars if they were waterproof as well.",Cute and cozy but not waterproof

4,"I purchased this as my old strap was very narrow and I was beginning to have shoulder pain; especially during long days of carrying the laptop.  I researched various straps (yes, search and you will find reviews on shoulder straps specifically).  There was another highly rated brand/model which I also learned was (or potentially) this brand sold by the different manufacture.  At any rate, I can say the shoulder area is very comfortable and this has made a noticeable difference (positive) in shoulder comfort.  I gave it a 4 vs 5 only because the strap part itself does have some elasticity to it which takes some getting used to; and perhaps helps with the comfort.  That said if you ever need to run/trot through an airport; think of carrying your ?lb bag on a rubber band over your shoulder.  Not terrible; but does take some getting used to.

Oh, and it is also very nice material that does not slide off your shoulder if that is a concern to you.",Nice Strap; comfortable and does not slide off

I ordered narrow but since they are called unisex, perhaps they are wider.  I am wondering if the new designation ""Arizona"" means medium soft.  I'd still like a softer pair.  These are definitely comfortable but not quite as much as my old ones.",These shoes are wonderful but are not as soft in the footbed as ...
4,Good jeans at a great price.,Four Stars
4,Nice pants but the waist was too small. Size 38 was really a size 36 waist.,Four Stars
4,"Really nice jacket, but could not give it 5 stars due to the differences from an genuine military issue M65. The size seems to be spot on, ordered a size large and seems to match up perfect to my military large regular M65. Furthermore, the material, zippers, and buttons all seem to be good quality and are located in the correct spots.

The differences are the material of the jacket does not appear to be at the same level as a military issue M65, feels a bit lighter to me. The built in hood is a little different and think a military issue M65 hood is a better design, but I don't really care because I have never used the hood on one of these anyways. Lastly, the inner layer of material is sewn together at the bottom with the outer layer, whereas on a military issue M65 it is not sewn, but I don't see this as really mattering too much.

So, while the jacket does vary from a military issue M65, I think over all it is a good quality jacket for the price.","Good quality M65, but slightly differs from genuine military M65 field jacket."

If you are hesitant on sizing, go .5 size or full size down than what you normally wear. I will be reordering in a smaller size. On that note, I was very impressed with how easy it was to return it. I HATE returning items but figured since I spent $60 I should probably get a pair that fit me. And Amazon did not dissapoint!

4,"I loved the boots, they fit well, are comfortable to walk in, and are roomy enough in the calf (at least for me, as I've thin shanks) for me to tuck in my pants if I wish.  The only thing that I don't like is that, on my left boot, along the upper crease where one's ankle bends, on the inside of the boot, there is a very hard fold that hurts the top of my foot like the devil when putting the boot on.  Once it is on, I can't feel it.

So I am in the process of heating it up a bit and rubbing some goose tallow on that inner fold to soften the leather; then I will try and rub that fold until it softens or at least flattens until it doesn't hurt my foot when putting on or removing the boot.

If not for that inconvenience, I'd easily give it five stars.","Great fit, but watch the inner folds!"
4,"I had an older pair of these in black in a size 34/34. It had lasted well so I decided to get more. Overall, I like the quality of these jeans and they fit me well. The reason I docked them one star is that sizing is not consistent. Buyer beware - just because a black 34/34 fits you in one color doesn't mean that a 34/34 in a different color will fit the same. Apparently, they use different fabrics for different colors, and possibly slightly different patterns as well. Some are thicker material, some thinner, some have spandex mixed in. I tried on a variety of colors and sizes and ended up with something that fit well.

The size 5 rainboots are definitely smaller than his size 6 See Kai Runs. The size 9 rainboots are the same length as my older son's size 9 Vans. It seems to me that the sizing is pretty standard.

My only complaint and the reason I held back a star is that the darn shoulder straps tend to slip out of the hook where you adjust them.  It doesn't hurt the usefulness but it is an annoyance in the morning when you are trying to get out of the house!  Other than that, I like it very much and would buy others from this company.",Comfortable Support
4,"I have been using these as my backpacking boots for a number of years. The original Altitudes  from the 90's and pair I bought in 2008 actually gave me a perfect no blister fit right out of the box. They also seemed to have a softer feel on my soles. The most recent 2 pairs (2011 and 2014) have a different feel the first time you lace them up and  I have one spot that rubs. But once broken in they are doing the job. Have not been able to get them locally n my size for a couple of years so ordered them online.

This 9.5 is definitely slightly bigger than 9.5 should be; even when I measure up to the exact one that I'm replacing this one with.

I presently have an old pair of a different model that's 8.5.  So I have to know which size to buy in the different models.  Not nice for such a big brand.  Clothing wise, I don't have this problem.

4,"Very solid watch and great for snorkeling or diving. It is simple to use unlike many of the watches on the market today. The rubber band takes a while to get use to. It appears to be made out of the same material as truck tires and I am sure you would get at least 80,000 miles on it. If a shark bit off your arm while diving, it would not be able to chew through the watch and it would come out whole looking like new. After wearing the watch for several days while vacationing in Hawaii, I got used to the band and it is comfortable to wear. I believe my wrist shape adjusted to the band.",Shark Proof

The only star I took off from its rating is because there was a small 'thread' coming out it after the first time I wore it, which as other reviewers put it, something expectable from synthetic fabric due to rubbing against the blouse.

The screen can and will get scratches on it if you are working with it on, but if you do not really notice them unless the light hits it just right.

The watch looks just like the picture, except that I would say it is overall darker than the picture shows.  The turn dial does occasionally dig into my hand, but it doesn't happen enough to be a burden.  My only complaint with the design of the watch is that the clasp on the band comes completely apart, and I would prefer that the two sides stay connected but just loosen.  I've worn it for 3 days and have yet to get it wet so I can't attest to the band retaining water, as is mentioned in other reviews.",A quality watch

I love the date feature and the back light option, as well as the ticking hand. I have had it for almost 7 months now, and the face and straps have held up very well- the only reason I am knocking off a star is because the leather sliding loop that holds the strap down has come apart and I can't reattach it- I have had to replace it with a rubber band until I can get it fixed and that's inconvenient and not something I had expected to come apart so early :/ If that hadn't happened, I would be completely satisfied with this purchase.",Just what I needed until strap loop came apart

I can't really return it as I don't live in the USA and it takes quite a bit of time and locally, my feet are huge and therefore hard to find flip flops in my size. The only comfort I can take in getting this pair of flip flops is that I'm only using them when I shower at the office or when my boots are soaked and I'm air drying them in the office hence I do not wear the flip flops often.

Nice shoe, fits well, seems well made, looks great.
The bad:
The insoles are terrible. The Gel heel pad is raised above the rest of the insole, which looks cool, but ends up concentrating the user weight on just the pad, which is roughly half the surface area of the heel. Heel pain starts after an hour or so of standing. Replaced the insoles, and now the shoes are wonderful.","Good shoe, bad insole"

They are very stiff and have no stretch, which is a bit of a problem when your a wheelchair user, you want a little bit of stretch. Heck even an able bodied person will want a little bit of stretch to accommodate movement. These are as baggy as rapper pants on me too. I'll go look into other brands for pants.

As far as tops Dickies has me sold but the pants either I need to buy from a different collection (not EDS) or go to another manufacturer.

4,"The first SPOT watch I purchased was the Abacus AU4004 (identical to the Fossil FX3005). Even though I only used the free service (which includes several news headlines, daily weather forecast and limited financial market information), I was hooked. However, several factors limited my enjoyment of the watch:

-Size of the watch face

-Comfort of the watch band

-Navigational buttons

The size of the watch face was larger than a typical watch and much thicker, making it difficult to wear long sleeve button shirts that could button over the watch. The watch band itself was very stiff and had a strange clasp. The navigational buttons seem ""hard"" and gave me a little finger pain if I pressed them too much while using the watch. However, for $40, these can only be considered minor problems.

I moved on to the Swatch Paparazzi because it was an unbeatable deal: for $60, you're getting the watch plus a year's worth of MSN Direct service (which normally costs $40/year). In effect, you're getting the watch for $20!

My experience with the Swatch Paparazzi was much improved over the experience I had with my previous SPOT watch. Even though the band is stiff, it is still much more comfortable to wear. The face of the watch is bigger than the Abacus/Fossil, and is almost as thick, but for some reason doesn't seem as obtrusive (I can easily button long sleeve shirts over it). The buttons are made of plastic as opposed to the metal buttons of my previous model, and I found the plastic buttons to be a huge improvement in navigational functions. Appearance-wise, the Swatch Paparazzi appears closer to a regular watch than other SPOT offerings do.

Having purchased a Suunto N3i recently, widely touted as the best SPOT watch available due to its slim size, I can honestly say I prefer the Swatch Paparazzi. Even though the latter is thicker, it somehow seems comparable to the N3i in terms of size and comfort. The screen on the Paparazzi is the best of all three SPOT watches I own, and it has the best buttons of the three by far (very soft, tactile and no finger pain!). The Paparazzi would have benefitted from having a softer watch band like the N3i, but the band it currently has is far from uncomfortable and much better than the band on the Abacus/Fossil model.

If you're looking for a watch that could help you pass the time while waiting on a line, whether it be by giving you news headlines, the weather, stock info, movie times, etc, I would highly recommend the Swatch Paparazzi as a comfortable, easy-to-use, affordable SPOT watch. Also, if you're like me and get tired of looking at the same watch face all the time, you'll really enjoy the many ""watch faces"" that are available for you to choose from to bring variety to your wrist and keep your watch from ever being dull. In terms of value, no other SPOT watch gives you as much bang for your buck. I would have given this watch 5 stars if it was a little bit less thick and if the band was a little bit more comfortable.

If you want more information on MSNDirect's services and the watches that are available, make sure to look up their website. For great reviews and additional information about all of the SPOT models out there, make sure to do a web search for the Spotstop website.",One of the better MSN Direct SPOT watches I've tried out

These Calvin Klein's perplex me.  Calvin Klein consistently makes all their clothing and apparel for a more slender cut.  I know because I'm big guy and can't wear most of their stuff.  That's why these Calvin Klein's perplex me.  For some reason they are a perfect fix in the body of briefs but the waist band is REALLY loose.  I don't mean that it falls down.  It stays against the skin.  It just seems like a much much looser elastic.  Like I said, I fit great in the briefs but I could fix two of me in the elastic.

I love the easy-to-use digital features, especially the countdown timer. I use it all the time for cooking or time-outs for the kids, or to remind myself that I really need to leave in 5 minutes!

Last time my hubby changed the battery he messed up the water-proof gasket so now I need a new one.

I agree with others that the included watchband isn't the greatest. That's why I only gave 4 stars. Long ago I bought a stretch band and now just swap it out.

I wear a 3XL tall in shirts, and a 4X regular will often also work for clothing that runs small. Since this would be going over my clothes, I ordered the 4XL regular. The ""girth"" of the coat was perfect for the size, but the coat was on the rather short side. If I were to raise my arms or attempt to bend over, I would definitely be showing my mid-section or my back side. For a coat that I bought for some extra warmth, this wasn't a good trait. The sleeves also seem a bit long for the size, but I could've lived with that.

4,"This genie costume is a onesie. The top and pants are one piece with a velcro snap in the back below the neck to close it shut.

It fit my 6'1"" husband great and it was hilarious. He got a ton of compliments on it and our kids still talk about it.

The fabric is pretty thin so we decided he had to wear jeans underneath the blue pants, so that it was more appropriate for children to see him in. Haha.

The mask was awesome. Half star off because it had a slight scratch on the nose where the blue rubbed off into white, probably the size of a dime. No one noticed, except me. If i cared that much I would have found a blue marker to fill it in, but it was fine for halloween night and a halloween party.

One more thing to note - there is no zipper! So everytime he went to the bathroom he had to take the whole thing down to his ankles. That is the other half star off.","Hilarious costume, but no zipper in the pants."

These shorts fit true to size and appear ready to take a beating.

The cell phone pocket fits my overly large LG v10 phablet like a glove;  from top to bottom these shorts are made with the plight of the working man in mind.

All the Blochs I've bought in the past (same style as this purchase) have been one size larger, but the last pair was a little too snug so I went up another half size this time.

4,I have had multiple pairs of these flip flops & love them so much. I normally buy them when I find them in the store but couldn't find any this past summer. I ordered these online hoping they would be exactly like I had bought previously. I was slightly disappointed (hence the 4 stars not 5) due to they are much wider & if you look very close to each pair one is a little bit of a darker black then the other. I kept them because the width wasn't that bad or the color. I'm not 100% sure if I would order them again online due to this so unless I can't find a pair in the stores near me next summer than I will be ordering from here again.,Super comfortable flip flops

I had the same model previously, and it lasted me three years until the hands stopped working, however I was not gentle with the watch, sometimes dropping it on a hard floor or accidentally banging it into things.

I was replacing another pair that looked similar but have had them so long that the fake leather was peeling off.  Yes, I even pulled a Julia Roberts and colored in the toes scruff with black magic marker. LOL. I just have a hard time finding shoes that are what I like as I'm not a high heel wearing person and these fit everything I was looking for in a new boot. The only com I guess I have is I wish they had a little more foot cushion but it's not horrible.",Perfect fit and size

4,"This is a great looking watch, and in the ten days I've had it, it's gained about one second. The size is perfect for someone with average wrists. Regarding the dial color, it is a beautiful dark blue in natural light (as seen in my pictures, taken indoors with sunlight coming through the window), I have noticed that under solely artificial light it can look a little closer to bluish purple, so I guess it depends on where you're going to be wearing it. The bezel is definitely lighter blue but they compliment each other nicely. I've worn it to the beach and gotten it pretty wet, without issues. It's not a Rolex or Omega, but for under $60 I don't think you can do much better.",Very nice
4,"I risked ordering pants online, because I've been a Dockers 44"" waist for years and years. The Signature Khaki is one of those ""individual fit"" or ""comfort fit"" waist bands, meaning it has hidden elastic on either side so that the waist can expand 2 inches. Problem, even without the expansion, these pants are about 2"" too big (that's a grand total of 4 extra inches!). Because the waist band expands so easily, it feels sloppy and unstable during activity. So, definitely wear a belt

For these 100% cotton pants the materials and workmanship are excellent with the good finish, such as welted pockets, we have come to expect from Dockers. Dockers used the hook-and-eye closure, which compliments the clean lines of the flat front. It is also a closure  preferred over a button to all who have any limitations making tight buttons holes difficult.

Recommendation, if your hips can stand it, try ordering a smaller than usual waist size. I tried following my own advice but could not. I would like any pair of Dockers, fit D3 or D4, flat front, with a hook and eye closure, and non-expanding waist band, preferably cotton, preferably welted versus flapped back pockets. I combed through the extensive Amazon Dockers listings over a period of weeks. Although I've found several good sounding descriptions of pants, NOT ONE was in my size (somewhere in the range of 44x30 - 44x28). NONE, nor were there any on the Dockers website, which means either my size is tremendously popular and can't be kept in stock, or the vendors are closing out the sizes they do have. I would replace my many increasingly worn and ratty Dockers in a heart beat, if I could find my size.

I am not recommending these pants, unless you have tried them on for size.",Fit not True to Size
4,"I've worn two watches of this model watch for almost 30 years. In that time, I've replaced several bands and a number of batteries. The alarm is loud enough to wake me, the chronograph function is convenient while exercising, and the light is bright, making for easy night reading. Original battery life exceeded five years in both cases. Of course this will vary, depending on how much you use the light and alarm. When my second watch died earlier this month, I decided to replace it with an analog style that's easier for my aging eyes to read. But if you like a dressy-looking digital, you can't go wrong at this price. It's only about 10% higher than what I paid in 1989.",Great watch for the money

Only minor beef with the watch is the strap - the loop that holds the end of the strap has a small tab in it, designed to catch one of the band strap holes.  That works, but it can be a pain in the backside to get the strap off.  I suppose I could cut that tab off with a sharp knife if I wanted to.",Great watch

After about 10,000 miles on the sandals, I ran into trouble: the hook for the ankle separate from the sole of the sandal. As a result, I immediately hopped on Amazon, pulled up my old order of a Size 10 Keen and reordered it! When the new sandals arrived, I was in shock because the shoe was _significantly_ smaller than before. In fact, to fit my _wide_ foot, I had to switch from a Size 10 up to Size 11.

A 10W too short, and 11M too much room in heel.

I ordered two pair of these slippers in two sizes and two pair of compression socks in different colors - slippers arrived in one box and socks in another. Returned everything and that's where things got complicated. Ended up with three different packages: First package had one pair of slippers and one pair of socks (in specific size and color), second package the other pair of slippers and the third package the other pair of socks. One package went to UPS the other two to USPS. Paid return shipping on one pair of slippers. Amazon's return process is unbelievably complicated. That was my biggest disappointment.

4,"I'm on my 6th pair of these starting about 8 years ago with the Altitude 3. Great support, durable and lightweight these have been my go to workshoes since I gave up blowing out Nike Air Jordans every 6 months at work at over $110 a pop. these will last you at least a year to 1.5 years of 8hrs/day, 5 days a week on your feet all day on concrete. Because its a boot it has more bottom tread cushion than a tennis shoe so when you walk there is not only more cushion for your feet but your stride is actually extended, like if you put larger tires on your car, you cover more distance with each stride thereby reducing fatigue. These are made by Sketchers and are generally great but there are a few problems I've encountered over the years using this shoe. I once ordered a pair from another online company, not Amazon but it starts with a 'Z' and after 2 weeks the shoe developed a squeak within the soles of each boot. you could hear me walking up behind you. I stopped wearing them for work but keep them around for dirty jobs or bad weather. Still, I loved the boot so much I bought another pair from a local store, which were fine. They switched over to a new design from the Altitude 3 to the Altitude 4 a year of two ago and the first pair of 4's were great and made in Camdodia. The most recent pair at about 6 months ago now were made in China and there were a few concerns. Number one was the leather quality in the Chinese model was rougher and maybe bonded or laminated in a way that caused it to release its surface finish at high abrasion areas around the outside of the toe, and to delaminate at stress points just behind the toe where bending happens. Secondly, one of the boots has rough eyelets for the laces and tends to eat through shoe laces at about 1 pair every 2 months despite my attempt to polish and sand them out. The Chinese version seem to be lesser quality than the Cambodian version. S I am looking for a comparable mid boot like maybe by Columbia but if I cant find one I think is comparable, I'll juist buy another pair of these.",I've owned 6 pairs of these.

4,"I Ordered the Newport h2 sandals because I wanted something with a good support for my feet. The foot bed is beyond comfortable! I love my sandals and wear them everywhere I go. These have been the only shoes that I have been able to wear right from the box and not having any problem with them. I wear a size 8.5 and I got a 9 which felt more roomy but I probably should've gotten the 8.5 because the back of the shoe still has a lot of room that is why I chose somewhat large for the rating. I gave these sandals a 4 star rating because they're already starting to come apart where the nylon strap is put into the foot bed, I'm not sure if this might be because they are a little to big or if they usually come apart here but I got these in the beginning of June and it's only been about 3 months. Another reason why I gave them a 4 is because they take a whole day to dry which is inconvenient when you have to wash them or have gotten them wet on accident and have no extra pair of shoes. The last reason why I gave them a 4 is they produce a horrible odor after a week and hand washing them has not gotten it out yet, I have yet to try the washer!","Overall good shoes, the good outweighs the bad!"
4,"The original Swiss Army Watch tells time well.  And continues to tell time well despite the lack of attention I give it.  This, of course, seems trite, but it is a watch, without frills, and it performs its functions better than watches costing significantly more, usually loaded with features of dubious utility.  This meets my standards for success.  Aesthetically, it will not appeal to everyone, but is only out of place in the most formal settings.  The only purely decorative feature is the Victorinox Swiss cross at the 12 O'clock position of the dial and the red ring around the dial.  Both are tasteful, restrained, and to my liking, but I can see how they wouldn't fit in an extremely stiff corporate setting or a tuxedo event.

Pros:

  -It has maintained correct time +/- 1 minute for over six months at a stretch.

  -Battery life has been great, 5+ years.

  -It is easy to read, with well-sized, strongly contrasted, and clear markings.

  -The luminous stuff on the hands and hour markings is as bright as you will find without investing in a watch with tritium markings.

  -It's light.  I barely notice it on my wrist, to the point where I have gotten distracted thinking I had forgotten a watch until I checked.  I think this comes from the synthetic (plastic) case, which has been absolutely trouble free.

  -The crystal has held up well despite a fairly active lifestyle.  This is not trivial, given the number of lesser watches that I have broken over the years.

Cons:

  -The date must be manually adjusted at the end of months of less than 31 days.

  -Arguably, its lack of features (it tells time, has a sweep hand and a date window, luminous markings, and...  um... er... looks nice and lasts well).  This is not a con to me, but if one needs specialized functions (like a scuba diver, a triathelete, a vessel's skipper, etc) it could be seen that way.

  Overall, a great watch and a worth while investment.  Were I forced to choose a single watch for an urban or corporate environment, this one would be in the final three.  The modest price and the less stiff/not overly formal appearance could carry the day for it.",It tells time well.
4,Great feel and I really enjoyed walking around in them with blue jeans,Good style

4,"These are very comfortable... I'm on my 15-20th pair now... They are easy to slip on but stay on well and feel good all day. Only drawback is the sole material wears down sooner than many shoes and gets so thin you can feel every pebble under your feet and they have to be replaced. If the sole was made of longer lasting rubber then the shoes would last a few months longer and be a better value. I'm looking at other brands for this very reason, but so far havn't found any others as comfortable as these are until the sole gets thin. :)",Great but wear out too soon.

4,"Okay.  I'm 54.  I don't see up close as well as I used to and I hate to whip out a pair of reading glasses just to see what time it is.  This watch is set up for left handed people.  When worn on the right wrist the winding/setting controls are opposite my wrist which is much more comfortable.  The face is big and masculine.  Easy to see even in dark areas.  It has been reliable.

I alternate this watch with an Invicta diver's watch and like them both.  I would buy it again.",Left hand and big.

The soles have extremely good traction!",Run a bit tight.

4,"Love these boots--on my third pair, after destroying (with great difficulty) two previous pairs. I wear these for hiking, yard work, and a part time professional landscaping gig as well as winter sidewalk shoveling and general all weather, all temperature tromping about. I've killed two pair, as I said, but it wasn't easy--the leather upper is thick, but supple. I put these on out of the box and wore 'em to the grocery store within 10 minutes, on my feet for two hours with no blisters--like good sneakers.  I wouldn't recommend a longer hike without a break-in, but it doesn't take much to soften them up.  The sole is the right mix of firm and flexible to make balance a non-issue, and it's plenty grippy in muck, though like most lug boot soles it doesn't shed the gunk that well so take 'em off on the porch if you don't want to get divorced.  Ankle support is superb, the toe box is roomy enough for thick socks, which I cherish as a wide foot guy, but not sloppy-big. Finally, a word about the waterproof layer--it appears to be some sort of ""bootie"" for lack of a better word that is sewn or glued inside the boot, and is tremendously waterproof but still breathable. I've spent long days working in all sorts of weather, and the only way for moisture to get in is through the top, but I've never gotten ""hot foot"" in the summer, like I have with more expensive boots.  I never meant to be a Hi-Tec advocate, but I'm a huge guy with giant feet, and the options for me are often few and expensive.  I tried these on a whim years ago, fully expecting to be disappointed, but what do you know, I'm hooked.  As Hi-Tec phases these out in favor of a newer model I'm actually hoarding extra pairs...just in case...because I've looked everywhere and I'm convinced that this boot is the best bang for the buck available for under $100.  A superb value.",Outstanding bang for the buck.

4,"When I first saw the price of the shoes, I thought I was getting a leather pair. If I would have fully read the item description, I would have realized it sooner than when I finally received the sandals.

 They're made of Brikibuc, which looks like real suede leather. The advantage is that if they do get wet, they won't stretch out like the leather ones will. The Birkibuc is also backed by a soft felt, so you don't have any plastic ribbing against your foot. I really love these with the Birkibuc, but I will buy real leather ones in the future.

 The only downside is that the tread is wearing down fast on these. I've only had them less than two months and my heals are practically gone, I don't know what they did, but I've never had Birkis where the tread wore down this fast!",I LOVES ME MY BIRKENSTOCKS!

They're a good thickness for work -- not so thick you can't see your legs, but warm enough to keep your commute not miserable.

Until now he's worn ones by Duluth; unfortunately they've gotten WAY too expensive and they're just not worth the price.  We ordered several pair of Riggs and found them to all be quite baggy on his slim frame (not just the ""relaxed fit"" ones--all of them).  The other brand looked better but not enough to justify their price.  We're happy to deal with some bagginess in exchange for the great value of these jeans.",Baggy but such a good value for gusseted jeans
4,"I really didn't need shoes but I bought these for use as a Walter White/Heisenberg Breaking Bad costume prop. The reviews I read said the size ran a bit large so I ordered a half size smaller. They were snug when I put them on, but not tight. I imagine they will stretch a bit because of the material they are made of. So half size smaller did work for me. They come in a medium width. So if you wear say an 11W, you might just as well order an 11. The reason I didn't give this a 5 star is there is hardly any ""ball of the foot"" cushioning. I'll have to add some kind of insert if I wear these other than for costuming. Heel is okay but the rest of your foot feels like it's on a cement floor.  For $90 I would have thought the shoe would have been of better comfort.
UPDATE- My review above was for the black Wallabee. I ordered again but this time in tan. Same quality, ordered a half size smaller.so the fit is good. These shoes automatically come in Wide width.

The insole comes out and allows for one to put their custom made orthotic inside.  They are super sturdy and if you need a sandal to travel with and do a lot of walking and have painful feet or a reason you must wear orthotics I highly recommend these.

4,"I owned a Casio F105W-1A Illuminator identical to this one that I bought at Walmart at retail for $22 in 2011, *not* the $55 that this watch supposedly lists for. I wore it daily for over two years until the band tore from use. I wear my watches slightly tighter than most people do and this may have caused stress on the band. It kept time for another year until sporadically dying, so the battery life on this model was 3 1/2 years for me. That watch may have been sitting on the rack for years before I picked it up, which would explain the short battery life. Keeps time very well and loses maybe a couple minutes over several months. Classic Casio styling, the original F105W was released in 1995 or 1996 if I recall correctly.

The only issue I have with this Casio Illuminator I bought off Amazon is that the display is slightly weaker than I remember it being on my old one and the illumination function is somewhat less bright. This doesn't make the watch illegible by any means but it is something I've noticed. I hope it's not due to a weak battery that is going to die soon but so far after over six months it still works great.

Appearance slightly different from pic because there is no insignia. Otherwise, the appearance is the same as picture.
HOW TO REMOVE SMELL:
Main reason for removing a star is the awful smell of manufacturing off-gassing when opening the plastic bag these come in. I had to get up and move these to another room because it made me feel ill. You can fix that if you have FeBreeze or similar product. Spray the de-odorizer into the boot until interior is wet all over. Stuff crushed newspaper/packing paper into the boot and let it sit for a few days, checking each day to see that it is getting better or if it needs more FeBreeze. After a few days I didn't notice the smell anymore and was still glad I got the boots.",Built well. Fit as expected. Removable Insole.  But...No insignia near top. Very Strong initial off-gassing smell.
4,"I followed the reviews stating to order a smaller size than your child wears and was very disappointed to find that they were too small. I had just had my child's foot measured at Nordstrom about a week before ordering these. His foot measured as an 8. I was planning on ordering a 9, but followed the advise of the other reviews and instead ordered an 8. When they arrived, they were too small.

4,"Ok, I bought these shoes for work thinking they would look good with my Khaki pants, which they def. did.  I wore them for a few hrs on the carpet at work to test them out. For me, the few hrs of wearing them was enough.
I gave this 4 Stars for a reason. First of all, I can't blame the shoe for me having been born with totally flat feet that needs support and cushion at all times. I thought this shoe would have that at this price point. Well, it didn't for me, but it would probably suit most people.
You can tell it's a well made shoe, and a very nice looking shoe also. I can see it being worn with Jeans up to casual dress pants.
Sadly, I have to return these shoes because I need more arch support and more cushioning. I wish I didn't have too, but it is what it is.
Plus, this is more of an outdoor shoe too, It is Goretex, and usually a shoe made this way is meant for more outdoor activity.
I had a pair of Ecco's before and they wore like a slipper. One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had on.
I don't want to discourage anyone from purchasing the shoe, since most who are looking at it probably don't have the issues I have.

I bought these pants when they first made them years back from ""Gemplers"".  It was the only place where you can get them.  Now they're available every where and that's when I noticed the quality issue. My first 2 pairs lasted the longest.  All of the new ones, they're rated for about a year.  These are the only pants I wear now, I've got 9 of them over the years and there is 2 brand new in my closet.  I've told all my friends about them, and they went and got some when they went on sale from ""Menards"".  They had the same issue with the frying between the leg as well.",Riggs Workwear pants

The other bra (black stripped one) seemed to have better stitching, but I'm not going to test it and risk having the strap pop off in the middle of the day.

Needless to say I am returning the item for a refund. It was a VERY comfortable bra for the few hours I got to wear it and was looking forward to using it when baby arrived.

No Lindy Bop tags/label and no other tags/label attached to the garment. 2.  Lindy Bop has a slip and two layers of mesh; this one has two layers of mesh only and no slip.  3. The waist area is poorly design with cheap fabrics. 4.  The elastic in the waist where the seam is suppose to be sewn close is coming apart and causing the elastic to twist on itself ... this is called poor measurements and sewing. Lindy Bop Petticoat has top notch sewing in that area. 5.  This product shipped from China ... Linda Bop products ships from the UK.

My other complaints.  ... 1. This petticoat is too big and too long for my Lindy Bop and other swing dresses.  2. This is not a well made garment. 3.  This is not what I expected.  4.  This is a KNOCK OFF of a LINDY BOP PettiCoat.  Shame on you using someone else name to sell your merchandise.

This SELLER is MISLEADING CONSUMERS!!!  Seller, I am 100% sure your product will and can sell ...  just sell the merchandise as who you are vs leading consumers into believing you are or have Lindy Bop's Products.

The collar was still too tight, the length was okay but the top and sleeves were ridiculously large and ill proportioned, very frumpy looking.

1,"I got a 36G. Band is too tight, digs into my skin around my ribs leaving deep bright red marks (I even measured with fabric tape before ordering). And, to top it off, the bra squeaks!? Not satisfied. ",Too tight & squeaky!
1,"Purchased b/c it was specifically sized for my bust size & shirt size (3x/44"") & b/c some reviews recommended this brand specifically over other brand of similar product. Unfortunately, the bra was WAY too flims for my 44"" bust. It had only 2 hook back closure, & the side of the bra was very narrow, maybe 1"" tall fabric, for 44"" bust. Underwire cups were also too narrow and too close together in the center.
Most women with a 44"" bust are not just petite women with ginormous boobs. I am nearly 6 feet tall and not a skinny woman. I'm a mom in my mid 40's & have had 3 babies, and my body shows it. It's often hard to find 44"" bras since most standard sizes only offer up to a size 42. I was excited to find a ""pretty"" bra listed in my size, which is why I was willing to pay$30 for a bra that wouldn't be part of my every day rotation. Just want to feel pretty for my husband every now and then, and was bummed this didn't work out. Think the manufacturers wanted to offer something for women of many sizes, and I applaud them for that. However, when actually putting on the 44"" bra for my true 44"" size, it seems like the only change they made was to extend the back of the bra by 2"" rather than take into account the actual anatomy of most women with the 3x/44"" size. We need more than 1"" side coverage and 2 hook closure in back. We've got side boob issues that need covered and supported, and when it is we can get a decent finished look without spilling over skinny bra sides and back straps. I normally don't take the time to review products on Amazon even though I am an avid prime member and shopper, but this product needs honest reviews from women of all sizes. Think it probably works much better for skinny or average size shapes than for those of us who are truly a 3x/44"" size.",Designed for non-plus-size women (in my opinion)

1,"We had specified an extra small size of this coat in chocolate when it appeared as a gold seal deal.  Instead of extra small  a medium size was sent, which is far too large for my daughter.  Despite several attempts of returning this coat, the Amazon return mechanism has not accepted any of my varied attempts to return the coat.  For this reason, I feel Amazon should either exchange this coat, and provide the appropriate size (""extra-small"") without any additional charges, or refund my money.

Thank you,

1,"I own 3 pairs of 2014 Hyperdunks.  I saw these for half off.  They advertise on Amazon as 2014 versions, but they ship as 2013 versions... and many of them are 2013's.  I much prefer the 2014's over these, so I sent them back.  False advertising will get you free shipping back to Amazon.  The best way to tell the difference is the top of the tongue... the nicer, better-fitting 2014's will have a ""V"" shape at the top of the tongue; the 2013's are rippled and more rounded up top.

The bright RED one in my pictures is the 2013...

To tell the difference, look at my pictures.  The one with 3 shoes in the picture has 2014's on the outside, and the 2013 in the middle.
2014 - Top of tongue is ""V"" shape, 2013 - Tongue is rippled/round and has ""Hyperdunk"" written on top.
2014 - lace area near toe comes to more of a sharp ""V"" shape... 2013 that is wider.
2013 bottom of shoe has two round shapes, 2014 does not.
2014 - has more mesh (all the way down to the toe).
2014 - has this U-shape technology - trust me, it makes your foot slip nicely into the shoe and then fits snug, not tight.  Good for all sizes of feet (mine are slightly wide feet - so it's a big deal to me).  The 2013's felt more rigid to me... didn't like that.

Again, biggest issue is that they mis-advertise... They show about 20 shoes, but half of them are the 2013's, and they still list them as 2014's (until you ship them).  So BUYER BEWARE!!!  and get the 2014's... they are much better.","Issues... Some of his shoes listed as 2014's are actually 2013's.  Look at my pictures, I'll explain."

I looked online to find out how to get the smell out, a post mentioned a gallon of distilled white vinegar mixed with warm water, so I tried letting them soak for 6 hours, then washed the clothes with twice the detergent.

As a side note, we traveled to 4 different stores looking for my daughter's gym shoe after this.  I was amazed at the number of shoes like this.  Companies advertise these shoes as lightweight (the soles were mostly foam), but failed to add enough true rubber spots to make sure these don't turn into a pair of ice skates on dusty gym floors.

1,"I purchased my first pair of ASICS Gel-Nimbus 15 shoes (Lot F350413, made in China) about 15 months ago and they have been the best running shoes I have ever owned. Normally I wear out a pair every 6 months but this pair is only beginning to show wear. Since I like these so much I decided I should order another pair before the style is retired only to find the new pair (Lot F580114, made in Indonesia) to be the worst pair of ASICS I have ever owned in 8 years of training. While the new pair looks identical to the original pair it completely lack the signature gel ""sponginess"" I have come to know and love. The original pair allowed me to both extend my training runs and cut down on my recovery time but the new pair have reduced my brisk runs to flat-footed, bone jarring jogs. I realize the Gel-Nimbus 15 is no longer the flagship shoe in the Gel-Nimbus series but ASICS has made a huge mistake by continuing to produce these shoes at sub-par quality rather than retire them. At this point I will never buy a pair of ASICS online again (no dig against the fine job the Amazon merchant did in promptly delivering what I ordered - this is strictly a manufacturing issue).",A once great shoe is now worthless to me

Well if you want a refund due to an error or any other reason to dang bad.  They have suggest I resell it or take a $3 (yes three) refund... Bottom line here, don't buy and don't use this seller.

There is no way on earth I would be able to wear this sports bra to do HITT cardio or lift weights in. Seriously, whoever designed this bra should be fired. Another thing is there is absolutely zero bounce control. It was extremely painful to jump in place. My girls were not kept in tight at all! You might as well be wearing your normal bra.

There was a needle and thread still in the dress, and I just barely managed to avoid sticking myself.

Greater foot width + taller foot = X

Solve for X, keeping your answer in terms of 'shoe'.

If you answered 'X = taller shoe', then your answer was correct.

But in the defective shoe manufacturer's mind, people with wide feet have no increase in foot height.

So picture a narrow foot. Now spread it out to almost twice that width, but do not imagine that it grows any taller. Does anyone else see a hobbit's foot forming?

If so, you are apparently NOT defective in math, like so many shoe makers. Unbelievable.",Typical extra wide shoe

After my son removed the costume, I inspected the crotch seam.  There were a number of runs and the seam was separated.  My son uses his old costumes to play and after 1-2 years those costumes are still intact.  If you buy this costume, thoroughly check it out before you need it. UPDATE:  Rubies has contacted me regarding the replacement of this product. After more checking, I found 2 more seam separations.",Many defects update

The THIRD band just tore on me. ie the original one, and two replacements have torn. Each replacement must be purchased from Timex for like $14.

Various colors are made up of different materials.  In one area of the description is says ""high rise.""  Wouldn't you think that means the jeans would come up to the natural waist line?  In another area it says ""below the waist rise.""  The waist does dip down in the front.
The leg between the hip and knee is noticeably snug.  I am not a hefty person.  The leg from the knee down flairs outward and has a bit of a boot cut effect.  One of the reasons I choose this pair is because they were to have a 15.25 inch leg opening.
They have been washed in cold water and hung to dry.  There are now horizontal lines showing across the mid section.  They will most likely be returned as the fit is off and the horizontal lines look terrible.  I wouldn't wear these out in public.  They are not comfortable to wear anywhere.

1,"I was truly looking forward to receiving this bag.  The dented and poorly taped box did not bode well for what was inside.  Although the merchandise was carefully covered with tissue to prevent scratches, the packaging lacked proper styrofoam or bubble wrap cushioning to protect against external force.  In addition, the bag itself was dented because it did not have enough stuffing inside.  Therefore, the dent on the box transferred to the merchandise inside.

The bag itself is beautiful if not touched and if viewed from afar.  The color is my favorite shade of red and the embossed croc finish looks good.  There are two cell phone pockets on one side.  On the other side, you will see two zippered compartments and more storage in between them.  Upon closer inspection, though, I found the leather to be stiff and really CHEAP, with an odor that makes me suspect this is not real leather at all.  The belt that holds the padlock does not completely compress the top resulting in a big opening on each side of the top - flawed design, in my opinion.  I could not tighten this because the belt is not adjustable - it does not go around.  Rather, each end is sewn on the other side of the bag.  The belt is fixed and is only for decoration.  I do not think that this bag is worth the money I paid for it,  so I am returning immediately.",Disappointing

1,Maybe I am a fool but I thought all watch bands are a standard size when it comes to fitting on to the watch and being attached by the pins. At least that's been the case for every watch band I ever bought. I bought this band for a Timex Ironman watch and it is too fat to fit between the frame that hold the pins. Plus even if it did fit it appears that it would not sit properly on the center of your wrist. I don't understand why it got so many good reviews!! Am I missing something?

Finally I was in so much pain I gave up and started wearing a different pair.  Haven't tried them on since - not happy :(  Just signed in to Amazon's website and found out I could have returned them!!  But the last day to return was 7/8/16 - yesterday!  That stinks.

1,"I was hugely disappointed in this product. I've had a great utility kilt I've worn for years and have been looking for a new one to supplement it. At first I got a size that was too big, but had a concern about the loose buttons when I received it. I got the better size (surprisingly a small/medium considering I'm 6'2, 180, size 33 jeans) which fit right. I love the heavy strong material, love the general design. But I was seriously chocked that they used such awful button snaps throughout the whole kilt. I mean, the moment you move, the snaps un-fasten! I've really never seen button snaps so horrible and cheap, especially for the most expensive kilt in their product line. I wish I could say something better, but this item is totally unwearable - I tried it for one night and it was literally being held on only by my belt. Nothing I could do would make the buttons stay on.

Do not buy this unless you are intending on replacing every button snap yourself.","nice material, horrendous button snaps. Won't stay closed. Do not buy."

I think that if you ship something that is fraudulent, there should be a little more than an apology.  I have been a Prime member for years and am pretty horrified over this experience.

Ladies - I buy designer jeans, and I love them.  I especially love Hudson's, but have many a pair of Citizens and Sevens as well.  I bring this up because I know what I am talking about when it comes to expensive, designer jeans. It is not lost on me that these jeans ring in at almost $200 a pair (gasp, ugh).  Therefore, they better make me look FANTASTIC, but they also better be the jeans I ordered and not some fraudulent piece of crap passed off as Hudson Ginny Denim Stella jeans.  I received the package and knew immediately something was wrong.  To summarize, in my horror, I realized this was NOT a pair of Hudson Ginny Denim Crop Stella Jeans, but a pair of petite bootcut Hudson's that had not only been *previously worn*, but had been significantly ALTERED (I COULD SEE THE ALTERATION SEAMS), and - get this - it did not have original tags, but had been purposely re-tagged with the wrong label.....which did not match the very obvious label on the inside of the jeans.  Sure, they were cropped, but only because they were altered bootcut jeans that were shortened to fit someone about 5 feet tall (I am 5'6'').  It is one thing to receive the wrong order, but it is another thing altogether to receive an order for what is supposed to be a new pair of jeans, and receive an altered, previously worn item, purposely re-tagged with the wrong non-factory label / tag for re-sale ...and....wait for it...pay almost $200 for it.

When I removed these from the drier the first time and tried one on I was in love. The main reason I got these as a tall individual was to help it so that I wasn't showing plumber's crack when I bent over, which is the case with traditional t-shirts.

These achieved exactly what I was looking for the first time I took them out of the drier...but unfortunately with each successive washing they have shrunk so much that they're on par with the other white t-shirts in my collection.

If you're in the same boat then I'm afraid to say that these aren't the t-shirts you're looking for.",Preshrunk....not really.

Major problem was that I ordered this as a gift, and when I opened the box, I saw a large yellow metal bracket between the earrings, kind of sideway, indenting the velvet! It looked like this had been a set with a necklace and the company just removed the necklace and sent the earrings on to me. I removed the bracket, but that just left the indent and a big hole in the velvet. Looks so bad I can't give them as a gift, which is why I bought them!

1,"You may notice that I posted a similar review on the Cumulus shoe on another page. The uppers on both Nimbus 15 shoes were much larger than normal and there was an odd shape about them that gave too much heel lift - I knew if I ran in them, there would be heel blisters. I ordered size 13. Noticed immediately when lacing up and wearing around the house to test - due heel lift and foot twisting inside the shoes, even with added Dr. Scholls heel pads. I am 68 years young, own (currently) 9 pair of ASCIS (2 worn pair for mowing the yard!). I have run for 50 years, always in ASCIS or New Balance since they became available, and never a problem.

 Suddenly, two different ordered pair from Amazon have defects. This pair and a Cumulus  pair. The Cumulus pair had too much material in the upper on the left shoe and the left shoe was a half size longer and would not hold my heel down, although I have a Nimbus pair bought last year at a store that does not have that issue. Both pair being returned were made in Viet Nam. Other reviewers have complained re: quality of shoes from Viet Nam vs. ok in US or China. I called ASCIS customer service. They state that the specs are given to each country and the shoes are the same, and that seconds are not offered for sale. Returned to Amazon OK with usual good service.

The solution is to test shoes in a bricks/mortar store first to get a good fit, be familiar with ASICS fit, return immediately if an issue. I hesitate to say avoid ASICS from Viet Nam but there might be a quality control issue there.",Is it a one time defect or is the quality control in Viet Nam poor?

After getting this I noticed the white parts were looking stained I washed with dawn all of it didn't come off. Looked pink. Well turns out it was due to my wool coat that is MK too and red!
I tried to wash off with dawn and never tried anything else. So I stopped wearing with the red coat then one day it looked black dirty grey after washing with dawn once again. Turns out my leather coat stained it too.
It does not seem to be sealed properly and absorbed colors. Also, the rise gold areas start to turn after like 6months. I contacted MK and they are replacing band thank god! But the fast is I can't only wear it on a limited basis knowing what I know. For the price on highly let down on the quality. It isn't real gold obvously sucks that it is sooo expensive and not worth it. If your band is stained contact them and ask for a replacement. Save your reciepts and tags and box. Don't send box when you get it repaired it won't be returned. I'm happy I'm getting mine replaced but the person who gave it to me was sooooo embarrassed about what happened to it.

1,"This case actually measures 6.25 x 2.75 x 1.5, which comes to a pocket-stuffing volume of 26 cubic inches. It's listed as being 5.75 x 2.25 x 1, which is only 13 cubic inches. I was looking for a smallish case roughly as large as this was advertised as, not a pants-ripping behemoth.
Even more importantly, though, the lining inside this case split the very first time I opened it. The lining just opened up and started to tear right along the hinge as I watched. Nothing lasts forever, but I expect it to be OK for at least a little while.
Last, and this is more to do with the shipper, the item was also obscenely over-wrapped. I mean, it's a metal case made to protect something, not a delicate piece of crystal. It doesn't need to wrapped in bubble wrap inside yards of tissue paper inside a plastic bag inside a padded envelope. I appreciate the effort, but at some point, its just adding to the landfill. The shipper (Warm Up Bandless Earmuffs) sent it super quick, though. No complaints there.

1,"I purchased these shoes on May 26th 2014.  Wore them occasionally, not every day and in any harsh environment.  July 24th 2014 I notice that the seam in the back of one shoe is now pulling apart.  It was poorly made and has managed to start falling apart in less than 2 months with only occasional wear.  God forbid anyone would actually wear it very often.  In most instances the sole of my shoes start showing wear well before the upper part of the shoe has problems... so apparently New Balance has gone down in quality from the past.  I can't recommend this shoe at all.",Poorly made will not hold up to any use
1,"I purchased a pair of similar Clarks shoes a few months ago, but wanted to use them for the first time only recently. Straight out of the box, the shoes were cut in between the leather top and the sole of the shoe. It looks like a material defect. I have sent pictures of the shoes to Clarks, and they acknowledge the problem as a material property that has to do with not wearing the shoes ""on a regular basis"" and they have offered me 10 British Pounds in compensation. The shoes were NOT labeled with ""date of manufacture"", ""expiration date"", that they would be ""guaranteed for x number years"", or instructions to ""use on a regular basis"". I am not satisfied with their offer and would like the shoes to be returned or exchanged, which they refuse to do.",Defective materials

This hat is offered in a multitude of colours. I picked teal based on the photo but it is much greener than appears on screen. Also, it was packed in a very roomy box, yet came wrinkled and I'm not sure ironing is going to fix that.. Nothing will fix the wrinkles on this hat and it looks scruffy on because of that. It will cost too much for me to return it but I would not recommend buying any Scala hats, based on this purchase, and based on the very similar positive reviews it has received recently to knock negative reviews to the bottom",Disappointing!

Asics changed the pattern from the 14 to 15. The shoe top material is a single piece of material in the 14 including the tongue. On the 15, the tongue is sewn on to the top shoe pattern. All kinds of frayed material was left in the shoe at the point where the tongue was sewn on to the rest of the shoe. Wearing the shoe barefoot was impossible and I could feel the frayed material through thin socks. I addition, the 15 toe box seemed smaller than the 14 in the same size (12). I have returned the 15s and purchased another (boring color) 14. I was very disappointed to fine such shoddy workmanship in the 15.",Faulty workmanship

Second, Amazon displayed ""Made in USA,"" but these are NOT MADE IN USA, BUT MADE IN CHINA.
Thirdly, as to the material, Amazon showed ""100% Cotton,"" but, in fact, they are 60% cotton and 40% polyester.
Unbelievable.
In addition, the 2 T-shirt are black and blue and the SWEAT SUIT is gray. As other reviewers wrote, these colors are not my expectation too. Although Amazon tells us ""colors and prints may vary,"" I cannot expect all 3 T-shirts will be in blackish colors from the advertisement.","Caution!!

1,"I changed my bag out and one of the files had ripped down the side. This explains my stuff in random places in my bag but I just thought it was me. The lotions and potions is the one that is torn. After using this for the month of March (a little over a month) I do not think this is worth the money. Anything that only lasts a month when your a mom isn't worth it at all. I was so in love with the idea I didn't really think through the fact that this is just mesh....
On another note when you fill the files up it makes your bag way heavier than it should or needs to be. I was recently at a show and I was showing this off to everyone and promoting the brand but I must admit I was had. If you pack your bag properly then you won't need this extra weight and hassle.
This wasn't my only complaint about this product. When I first saw this on a blog I went to the website and then found the product on Amazon. I did not realize that they made two versions. I really wanted the other version so I could make my own labels. I contacted the company and they said since I had opened it I could not return it but they would either offer free shipping or 20% off. That would have made this product around $70 since I would have been stuck with the original Amazon order. I trust everything on Amazon and that one of the main reasons I ordered this from Amazon. Bottom line if you make two versions and sell it on various sites....make it be known. Especially since you are having other peoples blog advertise it for you which is where I found out about this product. And make your product last. I do not believe there are people who use this daily and haven't had issues.  There goes $40 down the drain!",Loved it at first but then.....

1,"I ordered this bag specifically for an all-in-one bag - diaper bag & purse. It functions very well as a diaper bag!
PROS- The exterior pockets hold either bottles or kids water cups. Many interior pockets for small items.
Fabric cleans up easily, both inside & out.
Slightly Padded straps; comfortable but not too bulky.
Beautiful, bright print- I frequently get asked if the bag is Fossil.
My favorite feature is the magnetic closure on the main flap- this made reaching around retrieving items very simple, & the bag self-closed afterwards.
CON- after only 5 months, the magnet on the main part of the bag ripped the magnet off the flap!  Tore it right out of the fabric & it's now stuck inside the other magnet. I'll attach photos.
For the price I truly feel this should not have happened within the first 5 months. (I see the price has dropped since I purchased my bag)

I get better results from a plain jane compression shirt (tee shirt style) worn under my clothes.

I think the reason it's called ""hotter"" is because the damn thing doesn't breath at all.  It's 100% synthetic and twice as thick as a compression shirt...  I was sweating my @$$ off within 15 minutes of sitting at my desk wearing it.

The extra lapel shown does not sit properly when the jacket is buttoned and you cannot wear the jacket without buttoning it or it just flaps around. I was going to return it but the cheapest way to mail it back from the US to Germany costs $30 so be very sure you want to try this item before ordering.

As soon as they arrived it was clear that the material used to make them, from sole to fabric, was very cheap - although they charge enough for the shoe itself. I can see why kids want them - bright colors, even came with a little comic book - but it's clear that the investment is all in the marketing, not in the quality of the product itself. I was sure they'd wear out long before she outgrew them. My husband agreed, and luckily even my 7-year-old could see how poor the quality of the materials was.

When they finally replied they said the warranty was over. $200 lost. Also besides that, the first day i wore them i slipped flat on my back (luckily i had a backpack on to brace the fall) because the hexagon sole is bogus. it just cakes snow on the bottom and makes this shoe very dangerous. it's fine for fall and rainy weather but the material (sole) is garbage for the price. not to mention it was kinda ugly the front was obnoxiously wide. no one ever complimented me on it and people always compliment me on my clothing and shoes. not telling you what to do. but don't buy these.",disappointed

I've bought three pairs of kinsei 5, and all of them are ripping. And now? I'll lost all money that I payed? I think that ASICS must refund the consumers, by a question of justice. because there are a lot of complaints. Asics committed a manufacturing error.

Biggest feature it has a function to align hands just in case it magnetize or disaligns, once you follow the instructions you just position all the hands at 12 o clock position and that's all, press agin set and everything perfect, you can also aligh the little airplane indicator as well, how cool is that.

CONS: The digital piece is tiny and you cannot read it under poor light, however personally I don t care.

1,"broken very soon--big holes in the front, stiches fell off.... I bought the white uniform shoes here and the same model of black uniform shoes from another vendor and found the same problems with both shoes....","broken very soon--big holes in the front, stiches fell ..."
1,"They must have been on sale for a reason.  I just don't have the foot for these shoes.  If you're a large guy or have a slightly wider than standard foot.  Do not buy.

Amazon's return policy is always the best.  But these shoes just sucked.",Hands down one of the worst shoes i've put on my feet
1,"I really love the look, the fit was fine and these shoes seem to be will constructed but after a week of wearing them I've found a flaw. In the left shoe there's some sort of lump just forward of the midpoint of the arch that is very irritating and causes discomfort. I would have sent them back but due to wearing them at work I don't believe I can. If these were exchangeable they might get a higher rating but as they sit in my closet collecting dust due to the discomfort they cause they only get 1 star.","Look good, but not good QC"
1,"I measured my son's head, and purchased the size according to what the Product Description details indicated. The hat was too small. If their sizing details are accurate, it should have been loose. I'm VERY unhappy that I did my homework, and on top of having to return the hat, have to pay the shipping to do so.

Apart from that, the material used on the flap is cheap and stiff, not to mention short. It covered my five-year-old son's neck, maybe by half. Also, there were several long loose strings hanging from the brim of the hat in back.

I wasn't impressed with the inconsistency with of the Product Description, or with the quality of the hat.",Dissatisfied

1,"I received the Columbia Bugaboot Snow Boot a couple of years a ago as a gift.  They seemed nice, comfortable, and warm, but a little narrow than I would have liked for stability walking on ice.  I live in Virginia and have only worn them half a dozen times while shoveling snow from the driveway, or going to work on snowy days.

At work, I stood up from my desk and the leather top completely separated from the the rubber bottom.  Looking at the separation, I can only guess that it is held together with glue.  The stitching at the bottom of the leather does not go through the rubber to hold it together.

I called Columbia, and they informed me that all of their footwear have only a one year warranty.  So unless you live in an area with year round snow, they will only back their product for a couple of uses.  I would expect more from a brand like Columbia.

I have purchased many Columbia products for myself and as gifts for many years, but I will not again.",DO NOT BUY FOOTWEAR FROM COLUMBIA
1,The tread design is HORRIBLE except for outside or carpeted floors.  If the person steps on a slightly damp tile or wood floor it is like standing on wet ice.  I bought these for a cruise. I slipped 2 times on the cruise ship falling both times.  Other times I felt I was on an ice rink.  When I reached land I went to a TGIF for lunch.  I went to the bathroom but the floor seemed so slippery that I turned around and left the bathroom not using it. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES EXCEPT FOR OUTSIDE.  They are probably perfectly designed for running on the beach or terrain. I would not advise them to be used on any smooth or semi-smooth surface. If you are jogging and run onto a surface like that it could be dangerous!!,The tread design is HORRIBLE except for outside or carpeted floors

1,"I normally wear an 8 but ordered an 8.5 because Dr. Scholl's tend to run small. They were still too tight across my toes, and I do not have a wide foot.

1,"I'm very sorry that I purchased these shoes.  I have several pairs of Crocs and love them all.  However, these shoes in particular are very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until 2 hours in to wearing them, so I can't return them.  There are several aspects to the design of these shoes that make them extremely uncomfortable.  1. the back of the heel digs in to that back of your foot.  2. the top of the toe box is extremely long so it digs in to the top of your foot. If it weren't for these 2 things, the shoes would be great since the foot bed has all the padding that one would expect from Croc's.  I really wish I could return these:(.",Terrible!
1,"I've had this ring for a month now, and due to washing my hands, the black inlay first bubbled then cracked off.",Disappointed
1,I wore them a grand total of five times to my extremely laid back office job. I looked down today and they are developing holes! It isn't like I am actively rubbing my feet together either!

1,"I expected something larger.  $10 for these itty bitty bottles is ridiculous.  They are so small, you need an eye dropper to fill them and one drop, maybe two will fill the bottle. Extremely disappointed and no time to order from another company",Teenie Weenie bottles

It is a cute watch bracelet but it fell apart almost right out of the box. The leaf was on backwards, the snap broke the first time it was used, and the several leather strings aren't actually fastened to the main leather band. There was just some string wrapped around each end and wasn't even tied properly since that came apart too! It's like I got a bracelet making kit that was missing some parts.",don't buy!!!

Battery doesn't charge properly even when placed on window sill, always late even though he corrects the time every single morning. It's a shame SEIKO makes such a bad watch. I never had any problem with SEIKO watch before. Too bad it's out of the return window now. It's a huge mistake to buy such an expensive watch from online seller. I also had big problem with a so-called 10-year battery Casio watch bought from Amazon around the same(always late in less than 3 months). Now my husband is complaining about the 2 watches almost everyday :-(.",Why does SEIKO make such a terrible solar watch?!

1,"I am so disappointed about the quality of these glasses! I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I can't believe how anyone could give these glasses 5 stars. They are very cheap frames and terrible quality lenses.  These glasses look like there were 100 % USED! The frame is totally stretched out extremely wide (as when someone has worn them a long time ) the lenses were filthy, the case they came in was a piece of plastic junk not worth more than 50 cents. I just wasted my money and my time. Now I have to deal with returning them. What a headache. These are not comparable whatsoever to prescription lenses. My $8.00 glasses from CVS are better than these.",Nothing But Junk
